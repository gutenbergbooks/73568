<p class="firstpara">On the 10th of July, 1881, Bucher wrote me the
following note in pencil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Chief is having articles written on the played-out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>
Liberals in the Vienna Parliament, from which a
moral is drawn for our own people. It would certainly
amuse him to see Glaser’s letter, a precious production,
which you will find in the enclosed book, reprinted.
What do you think of the idea?</p>

<p>“In a few days I shall send you a pamphlet on the
Cobden Club (written by me, of course secret). I
would suggest that it should not be discussed until
after the silly season, somewhere about the beginning
of September, when we must again hammer away at
the subject. I shall then supply you with plenty of
material. In the meantime, it may be well to collect
together the abusive language to which the pamphlet
has given rise.</p>

<p>“In eight or ten days I shall send you an article on
the origin of the Anglo-French Treaty of Commerce,
which may be published immediately.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Br.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>


<p>Glaser’s letter appeared in a small pamphlet, entitled,
<cite>An Austrian Minister and his Father</cite>, published in
Berlin, 1872, by Kerskes and Hohmann. It contained
the following passage: “Another year, and the Chosen
People shall have attained the object of the Holy
Alliance,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which they concluded in Paris. We have no
more ardent desire than to see the day arrive when we
can bid him (Prince Adolph Auersberg) good-bye, and
see his place taken by one from our midst” (the Jewish
Liberals); and “then” (when the aristocratic party is
suspected by the dynasty, and has fallen out of favour)
“a really new and regenerated nobility, drawn from our
people” (the Jews) “shall enter into power, and fulfil
the mission to which God has called them.” I had this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>
letter reproduced in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, with a few introductory
remarks.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th of July I called upon
Bucher, from whom I ascertained that he had collected
the material for his pamphlet on the Cobden Club in
the British Museum, about a fortnight previously. He
had gone to London, under instructions from the Chief,
giving a false name, and holding no intercourse with
anybody.</p>

<p>On the 21st I called on Bucher at the Foreign Office,
to remind him about the pamphlet and the proposed
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article. He had been unable to write the
latter, as he could not obtain a book which he required
for the purpose. (This was the <cite>Principles of Currency</cite>,
a work by the Oxford Professor, Bonamy Price, which
appeared in 1869.) He gave me his pamphlet, and a
quantity of material for the article upon it, to which he
made some additions during the following days. He
also sent me a number of English and French publications,
to be used for the same purpose. In the meantime,
Glaser’s letter was emphatically declared to be a forgery
by Glaser himself. Bucher, however, still held it to be
“genuine in the main.”</p>

<p>I now wrote a series of five articles, entitled
“Characteristics of the Manchester School,” based on
Bucher’s pamphlet, and the notes and books with which
he supplied me. These appeared in Nos. 33 to 37 of
the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July Bucher related to me “an
anecdote illustrating the way in which the Secretary of
State von Bülow carried on business.” Lasker called
upon him one day to introduce a Frenchman, one Comte
de Jolivar, who was going to Constantinople, and wished
to have a letter of introduction to our Embassy there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>
Bülow had this letter prepared, and added in his own
hand a few words of warm recommendation to Werther,
who was our representative at the Porte at that time.
The Comte proceeded on his journey with this document
in his pocket, and one of the first things he did on his
arrival at the Golden Horn was to swindle a German
artisan out of a respectable sum of money. This was
soon followed by similar operations, which speedily
came to Werther’s ears, who probably had already felt
surprised at the Frenchman having asked for and
received recommendations from the Foreign Office in
Berlin, instead of from that in Paris, or from the French
Minister in Berlin. He reported these cases of swindling
to the Wilhelmstrasse, and from there inquiries
were addressed to the Foreign Office in Paris. The
information received was to the following effect. Comte
de Jolivar is not a Comte, but only a Chevalier, that is
to say, <i lang="fr">chevalier d’industrie</i>, who&mdash;as the police records
show&mdash;has been condemned on several occasions for
embezzlement and swindling, and was once prosecuted
for forgery, but just managed to save his skin. “<i lang="fr">Tableau</i>”
in the office of our Secretary of State!</p>

<p>Bucher praised Hatzfeldt, who has entered upon the
duties of his office in succession to Bülow, as a pleasant
and easy chief. Speaking of Bunsen, Bucher said that
he had written for the Secessionist <cite>Tribune</cite>. Bucher
also referred to the controversy which he had recently
fought out with Bunsen, in the columns of the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>.</p>

<p>On the 29th of July I received the following note
from Bucher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“1. Can you get the enclosed inserted in the
<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, or some other English newspaper, and
send the Chief a copy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span></p>

<p>“2. Herewith the draft of an article on the commercial
treaty, of which you must alter the introduction.
The second edition of Bonamy Price which I have
received from Baden (whence he also obtained the
<cite>Sophisms of Free Trade</cite>, which he sent me for the
‘Characteristics of the Manchester School’) does not
contain the letter from Chevalier. I have instructed
Ascher to get the first edition at my expense, and to
forward it to you.</p>

<p class="right">
“Yours, <span class="smcap">Br.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The enclosure mentioned in paragraph 1 ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It appears that a secret society has been formed in
Russia, by a number of determined and loyal subjects
of the Tsar, which is understood to be organised on the
same lines as the associations founded for the purpose
of assassinating him. This new society purposes to
fight the Nihilists with their own weapons. Like the
latter, who seek to terrorise the sovereign by attempts
upon his life, the new society which has been constituted
to oppose these criminals, will endeavour to keep
them in check by hunting out and killing the chiefs of
the band of assassins in Switzerland and England. It
is a regrettable circumstance that honourable men in
Russia should be obliged to resort to a kind of mediæval
<i lang="de">Vehmgericht</i> as a means of protecting the monarch
from these miserable cut-throats.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the morning of the 30th I forwarded this
paragraph to the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, stating that it came
from the “very best source,” and adding that I should
be thankful for its insertion. On the 31st, however,
I received the following note from Bucher: “Herbert
has just telegraphed to me to hold back the paragraph
on the Anti-Nihilistic society for the present. Luckily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span>
Sunday has intervened. Will you please countermand
it by telegraph, and charge me with the costs?” I
accordingly telegraphed to London, and the paragraph
did not appear.</p>

<p>The second enclosure was worked up for the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>,
and published in No. 32, under the title of “The
Genesis of the Anglo-French Commercial Treaty.” It
was completed by an extract from Chevalier’s letter,
which was published by the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on the 30th, I received the following
note from Bucher: “As your articles on the
Manchester School in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> will one day
form material for the historian, I would suggest that
after the reference to Schlesinger and his association
with the Treasury, you should insert the words:
‘since the Macdonald affair at Bonn.’ I will give
you the particulars for your memoirs. They are very
curious.”</p>

<p>Bucher left for his holidays on the 1st of August.</p>

<p>On the 14th of September Bucher wrote to me that
he was in Berlin, and on the 21st I called upon him.
He told me that the Chief had again had “difficulties
with the Emperor.” The latter now reads no more
newspapers. Recently, however, some courtier must
have called his attention to a paragraph which he represented
to come from the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung</cite>, to the effect that a Papal Nunciature was to be
established in Berlin. The Emperor thereupon wrote
the Chief a “snappish letter” which commenced somewhat
in the style of Zwückanör (one of the comic
figures in the <cite lang="de">Kladderadatsch</cite>): “I am much surprised.”
The Chancellor first sent a short telegram, saying that
he knew nothing of any such paragraph in the newspaper
in question (which had contained nothing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span>
kind), and afterwards forwarded a memorandum on the
subject, which filled three sheets of paper. “He was
greatly incensed at the action of the Most Gracious.”
Tiedemann, who has now been definitively replaced by
Rottenburg, goes in the first place to Bromberg, in the
capacity of <i lang="de">Regierungspräsident</i>, and not, as he had
desired, and expected, to Kassel as <i lang="de">Oberpräsident</i>. The
mention of Keudell in the first <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article on the
Manchester School, which has been described by the
Progressist press as a “violent attack,” has led that
gentleman to state in the <cite>Morning Post</cite> that he had
requested the President of the Cobden Club to remove
his name from the list of members. He at the same
time endeavoured to defend himself in Progressist
journals, like the <cite lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</cite> and the <cite lang="de">Berliner
Tageblatt</cite>, concluding, as usual, with self-praise. Bucher
remarked: “These almost identic articles are written
by himself. Only his signature at foot is wanting.”
These productions were forwarded to the Chancellor at
Varzin, who thereupon had the following statement
published in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The <cite lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</cite>, the <cite lang="de">Schlesische Zeitung</cite>
and the <cite lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</cite> publish articles respecting
Herr von Keudell which are similar in effect, and which
all conclude with the phrase that owing to his retirement
from the Cobden Club the valuable services of the
German Ambassador in Rome still remain secured to the
State.</p>

<p>“It requires that complete ignorance of the customs
prevailing in the service of the State, and particularly in
diplomacy, and of the habits of the higher circles which
distinguishes Progressist writers, for any one to imagine
that an Ambassador’s position could ever be endangered
by a matter of such trifling importance as the circumstance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span>
that he had been nominated an honorary member
of the Cobden Club six or more years ago. We are in
a position to assure our readers that the matter has
never been taken into consideration either officially or
confidentially at the Foreign Office, nor has it ever
called for any inquiry or exchange of views. The whole
story as to the position of Herr von Keudell being in
the least affected by that circumstance is simply an invention
of Progressist writers, suffering from a dearth of
‘copy.’</p>

<p>“We are not aware whether Herr von Keudell has
resigned his honorary membership. If such be the
case he will probably have been led to take that
step by recent disclosures respecting the Cobden
Club. So far as his relations to the Imperial
service and the Imperial Chancellor are concerned,
however, it is a matter of indifference whether this
purely private step has been taken or not. That Progressist
journalists believe the contrary is the consequence
in part of their ignorance as to the relations existing
between respectable people, and in part of their own
sentiments, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, of the furious rancour with which these
partisan writers exaggerate and garble the most insignificant
incidents. They assume that an equal degree
of malice and violence prevails in circles to which they
have no access. In short, they are partisans who are
accustomed to treat with hatred and contempt every
shade of difference from the party standard. In their
eyes whoever is not a free-trader is either a knave or a
fool. This is natural enough in those whose sole claim
to honesty and intelligence is that they are free-traders.
It is not so in higher circles, where there is more toleration,
and less time for matters of secondary importance.</p>

<p>“The Imperial Ambassador, moreover, can hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span>
care, we believe, to find unauthorised representatives
and advocates in just such papers as the <cite lang="de">Berliner
Tageblatt</cite> and the <cite lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</cite>. No one who does
not belong to the political and social circles represented
by these papers would willingly be credited with any
connections with them, and this is doubtless sufficiently
well-known in Rome for any such connection to be
shunned, and for such damaging advocacy to be duly
repudiated.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the morning of the 25th of October I paid
Bucher a visit at his lodgings. He complained that the
Chief now occupied himself too much with press matters.
Instructions of this description came from Varzin almost
daily, and sometimes three or four together. No one in
the office understood anything about them, neither the
sons, nor Rantzau (who was paid for that purpose, but
who, nevertheless, could only take down dictation from
the Chief), nor Holstein, who was a mere “bungler,”
and least of all Rudolf Lindau, who “is quite incapable,
has had no political or journalistic training, and can
merely play the amiable, tell good stories and go out
walking.” He had been brought into the Office by
family influence, which also kept him there. “In
Japan he made the acquaintance of Brandt, our Chargé
d’Affaires, through whom he obtained a connection with
the Intelligence Department of the general staff. He
afterwards (if I rightly understood) accompanied Brandt
to St. Petersburg, where he was presented to the Grand
Duchess Hélène, who recommended him to Bismarck.
The latter sent him to Harry Arnim in Paris as a Press
Attaché. He afterwards received an appointment at
the Foreign Office&mdash;again on an exalted recommendation.
The Prince knows that he is entirely unfit for
the duties which he has to perform, but the Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>
Duchess protects him; and so, although he has been
virtually shelved, it has been done in such a way that
he appears to have control of press affairs.”</p>

<p>Bucher said that Count Bill is on very intimate
terms with Paul Lindau ... with whom he had been
in Hungary. Herbert had yesterday, on the instructions
of his father, written Bucher a four-page letter, which
he showed me, asking him, Bucher, to make a “journalistic
onslaught” upon the Progressist candidate Klotz
on account of his election speech. Rantzau, however,
had been unable to obtain the most indispensable of
essentials, namely Klotz’s speech, and, in fact, knew
nothing whatever about it. One of the Chancery
attendants, however, was cleverer, and remembered that
it had been printed in pamphlet form and distributed
by the thousand. This man arranged to procure a
copy.</p>

<p>“Sybel is another plague with which the Chancellor
has afflicted me,” continued Bucher. “It is not so long
since Sybel was fighting against the Chief; but he has
now been taken once more into favour, and is to write
a history of Germany from 1860 to 1870.” For this
purpose the Chief had at first ordered that <em>all</em> diplomatic
documents of this period should be laid before
him. Bucher, however, pointed out that it would be
necessary to make certain exceptions, some of which he
mentioned, including those concerning the Hungarian
Legion. The Prince agreed to this, and arranged that
the documents mentioned by Bucher, as also the
“Secreta,” should not be shown to Sybel. The latter is
now carrying on his researches at the Foreign Office,
which Bucher does not regard as dangerous. He has
come upon references to the documents that have been
withheld from him, and has asked to see them, stating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>
that he would anyhow have possession of them some
day as Director of the State Archives. Bucher was,
however, obliged to refuse his request. He complained
of the responsibility imposed upon him in this matter.</p>

<p>He then went on to say that it was much the same
with one Herr Poschinger, a Bavarian, who had taken it
upon himself to describe Bismarck’s work as Envoy to
the Germanic Diet in Frankfurt. The Chief had given
instructions that he was to see everything relating to
this period in the first and second departments of the
Foreign Office. Poschinger plunged into these, and
then sent his <i lang="la" title="body of work">opus</i> to the Prince for revision. The
Chief did not care to read it, and instructed Bucher to
do so. “I then found that it was merely an endless
string of extracts, and not a book but only materials for
a book; and that while he dwelt discursively on insignificant
details, he cursorily dismissed or overlooked
altogether matters of real importance.” That was
pointed out to Poschinger, who revised his work in
accordance with the suggestions made to him, abbreviating
some parts and amplifying others, and then
returned it to the Chief, who again forwarded it to
Bucher. “It was now better material,” continued the
latter, “but it was still no book. I reported to the
Chief in this sense, and he gave instructions to obtain
Sybel’s opinion on it. His agreed in the main with my
own, but Poschinger discovered that Sybel had criticised
him.”</p>

<p>Bucher thought that the visit which the newspapers
reported Gambetta to have paid to Varzin about ten
days ago was possible, and indeed probable. He
declared, on the other hand, that the discovery, made
by the <cite lang="de">National Zeitung</cite>, that this visit took place at
Friedrichsruh, was unfounded, because the Chief was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>
that time suffering from severe pain in the back, which
made it impossible for him to travel. “I do not like to
make inquiries on the subject,” he said, “and I therefore
know nothing positive about it. We should have reason
to be thankful, however, if the visit took place, as it
would make Gambetta impossible in France.”</p>

<p><i>October 28th.</i>&mdash;Met his Excellency von Thile to-day
in the Potsdamer Platz. We first spoke about the
elections. Thile had formerly abstained from voting,
but this time&mdash;like Bucher and myself&mdash;had voted for
Stöcker. He then asked what I thought of the report
that Gambetta had visited the Chancellor. I replied
that it appeared to me to be possible, and indeed
probable. “I will tell you something,” he said. “One of
my acquaintances was recently at Frankfurt, where he
put up at the ‘Russischer Hof’&mdash;you know, ‘Auf der
Zeil.’ In conversation with the landlord, with whom
he was acquainted, he asked whether there was any
news. ‘Yes, and something of importance, Excellency,’
replied the latter. Gambetta was here recently on his
way home from Germany, and lodged with us. The
head waiter asked his servant where they had been, and
the man replied: ‘<i lang="fr" title="We have been on campaign around Danzig">Nous avons été à la campagne dans
les environs de Danzig</i>.’”</p>

<p><i>November 9th.</i>&mdash;Called this morning upon Bucher
at his lodgings to inquire about the article in yesterday’s
<cite>Post</cite> stating that the Chancellor proposed to resign. I
fancied the article came from Varzin, and was intended
to prepare for a dissolution of the Reichstag, and to
give the country an opportunity to choose at the
elections between the Chief and the Liberals. According
to Bucher, no one would believe that a general
election would induce him to retire, and as to the
dissolution of the Reichstag, that could only take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span>
if it perpetrated some piece of stupidity. The article
was purposeless, merely an expression of ill-humour at
Varzin, which Herbert, “with his usual ineptitude,”
had made public. “But they have been in the backwoods
for half a year, and do not know what is going
on in the world. The elections would have turned out
better in many respects if the press campaign had not
been so foolishly conducted. But these things are
shockingly ill-managed at present. We have now no
less than four Secretaries of State: Busch, the real one,
who is good; then Herbert at Varzin; and Rantzau and
Holstein here. These know nothing, and are incapable
of doing anything properly. None of them reads the
papers or knows what is going on, and if the Chief
gives violent instructions they are carried out with still
greater violence. It is sad that the Chief should think
so much of providing for his family and finding places
for them. Virchow was right when he brought that
charge against him. And the other gentlemen are no
better. In addition to the Secretaries of State we have
the gentlemen who spend their time strolling about,
and who are more often to be found out shooting than
in their office.” He then mentioned two, including
Radolinski, ... and added: “After all it was just
the same formerly, when, in addition to Thile, there
were only two who really worked, yourself and Abeken.
Hepke had hardly anything but trifles to deal with, and
the aristocrats for the most part spent scarcely two
hours in the office, just for a little gossip and a glance
through the newspapers and despatches&mdash;Hatzfeldt, for
instance, and Keudell, who was incapable to boot.”...
“Hatzfeldt rarely came before two o’clock,”
said Bucher, “and often went away again at three.
While they lived upstairs he usually came to play a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span>
game of croquet. He would ask Wartensleben, ‘Now
what do you think of a little game of croquet to-day?’
Wartensleben used then to say he would go up and see
whether the Countess would care to join them, and
when he came back with the message that the Countess
begged to be excused as she had something else to do,
Paul would remark, ‘Well, then, one may as well say
good bye,’ and take himself off.... And Keudell
could really do nothing. I suppose I have already told
you the story about Taglioni and Keudell’s thirty
arrears of work? Well, at Versailles I was told by
Wiehr&mdash;you remember him, the fat, bald deciphering
clerk&mdash;it was simply frightful how little Keudell
managed to do. When he sat down he wrote two or
three lines, then pulled out his watch, took the rings off
his finger and played with them, put them on again,
wrote another few lines, stopped once more, and finally
rose, leaving his work unfinished. On one occasion
Taglioni took pity on him and offered to assist the
Councillor. The latter was delighted with such an
amiable fellow, and Taglioni actually disposed of some
thirty items of work which were in arrear. But in
spite of that a number of even sensible people had a
high opinion of his power of work and his intelligence&mdash;people
such as Gneist, for example, whom I know
well, as we studied together. I always meant to
enlighten him, but have not done so yet. It is
necessary, however, that people should know Keudell if
he is to be a Minister one day.” Bucher then came to
speak of Count Herbert again, and I said that the
Prince had once observed to me that he had thought of
promoting him to be Secretary of State, as he had
worked for seven years under his own personal supervision,
but that he was too young. “Yes,” rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>
Bucher, “and so he is still. Paul Hatzfeldt will not
remain. Things will go on for the present in the same
way. He comes at two o’clock and disappears again at
five, attends to nothing beyond the interviews with
foreign diplomatists, and troubles himself very little
with the other business&mdash;which, for the matter of that,
is no loss. But when the Prince comes back, and he is
summoned to receive instructions two or three times a
day, it will not be at all to his liking, and he will go
back to Constantinople. He will be replaced by
Herbert, that haughty and incapable fellow, and more
than one of the officials will leave.”</p>

<p>I asked, in conclusion, if he knew what the Chief
had intended by the article on the Anti-Nihilistic
society which I forwarded to the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, and
afterwards countermanded. “The Holy Drujina?” he
said. “That was true. Such a society had been
formed under the protection of the Emperor, who had
subscribed a million and a half to its funds. Despatches
have been exchanged between ourselves and St. Petersburg
on the subject, and one of the members of the
society has called upon Rantzau. But I cannot conceive
what the Chief can have intended by the publication of
the paragraph in England. If one of those gentlemen
were to go there and murder a Nihilist leader, he would
be hanged as a matter of course. The affair should have
been treated as a profound secret, yet in a few weeks’
time it appeared in full, with all manner of details and
humorous comments, in the <cite lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</cite>. When
I mentioned this to Rantzau afterwards, he was simply
terrified. Of course he had not read it, and wished to
know where it had appeared. I told him the name of
the paper, and let him hunt up the number himself. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span>
used formerly to get him the paper on such occasions,
but now leave that to him, so that he may have at least
some occupation.”</p>

<p>As I left, Bucher said: “If anything happens, I will
let you know.”</p>

<p>The Prince returned to Berlin in the afternoon of
the 12th of November. At noon of the 15th a Chancery
attendant brought me a letter from Sachse, saying that
the Chief desired to see me at 1 o’clock on the following
day, Wednesday. I arrived at the time appointed,
and was shown in to the Prince at a quarter-past 1.
He had been dictating to Count William before I went
in. The Chancellor, who was in plain clothes, looked
fresh and hearty, but began by complaining of his
health. He had been ill, he said, during the whole five
months of his holiday, even at Kissingen, but particularly
at Varzin, where he had had to endure great
pain. It was his old trouble.</p>

<p>He then spoke of the elections, and stated that in
certain circumstances he would retire, as he had already
intimated to the Emperor. “The centre of gravity has
changed,” he continued. “The Progressist and Secessionist
Jews, with their money, now form the Centre.
At first I was not in favour of this agitation (for Stöcker
as an Anti-Semite). It was inconvenient to me, and
they went too far. Now, however, I am glad that the
Court Chaplain has been elected. He is an energetic,
fearless, and resolute man, and he cannot be muzzled.
The elections have shown that the German Philistine still
lives, and allows himself to be frightened and led astray
by fine speeches and lies. He will not hear of the protection
of labour against the foreigner, nor of insurance
against accident and old age, nor of any reduction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span>
school and poor rates, but wants direct taxation to be
increased. Well, he can have that, but not while I am
Chancellor.”</p>

<p>“Do you seriously mean that, Serene Highness?” I
asked. “I believe they have only nibbled at the
democratic bait just as they did formerly.”</p>

<p>“It may be that they do not quite know what they
want. But they have taken this course at the elections,
their representatives vote against me, and, in order to
govern I must have a majority&mdash;which I cannot find
under these conditions. In case of necessity it might
be possible to manage with a coalition of Conservatives
and Clericals and such like, but the Centre Party has
been against us all through the elections, and there is
no trusting them. Folly and ingratitude on all sides!
I am made the target for every party and group, and
they do everything they can to harass me, and would
like me to serve as a whipping-boy for them. But when
I disappear they will not know which way to turn, as
none of them has a majority or any positive views and
aims. They can only criticise and find fault&mdash;always
say No. You are right in saying that they have turned
the people’s heads with their fine phrases and lies.
They make out that I am in favour of reaction, and
want to restore the old <i lang="fr">régime</i>. If I can get my
monopoly, tobacco will cost three to five marks a pound,
but cigars will be three times as dear as they are now.
They have frightened the people by reviving the old
stories of the past, Junker rule, the <i lang="fr" title="obligatory labour">corvée</i>, territorial
jurisdiction, and even the <i lang="la" title="right of the first night">jus primæ noctis</i>, as, for
instance, in Holstein and Lauenburg. There the
Danish Kings had allowed all the ancient institutions
to remain&mdash;unadulterated mediævalism. The Junkers
ruled, and were decorated with the Order of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>
Elephant. They took all the best posts as if they had
inherited them. They held the most remunerative
offices up to ten thousand thalers a year, or at least
four to five thousand thalers; and yet they neither
did nor could do anything except pocket fees and
impose heavy fines. They farmed the domains among
themselves, on the lowest valuations, and lived on the
fat of the land. When I came there the people were
obliged to drink the abominable beer which the Junkers
brewed on their estates, and no one could purchase a
piece of ground because they did not wish the population
to exceed two thousand to the square (German)
mile. There the people still remember all this misrule,
and emissaries of the Progressists and Secessionists&mdash;who
are just the same&mdash;threaten them with its revival,
and warn them against me. I am represented as desiring
to restore that state of things, yet the contrary is
the case, and it was I alone who abolished it.”</p>

<p>I reminded him of the homage of the Estates in
Lauenburg, Bülow’s anxiety respecting the maintenance
of the Compact of the nobility, and the scene in the
Ratzeburg Cathedral, asking if that was a correct account
of the incident. He then related it to me once more, the
narrative agreeing in all important particulars with that
already given. Returning to the agitation that preceded
the elections, he continued as follows: “They do not,
however, even believe what they preach. They hate
and slander me because I am a Junker and not a Professor,
and because I have been a Minister for twenty
years. That has lasted too long for them&mdash;hence their
vexation. They would like to come to power themselves,
and form a Government. But that is mere covetousness,
and not ability, and if I were to make way for them they
would be desperately embarrassed, and would recognise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>
that they could do nothing. I was born a Junker, but
my policy was not that of the Junkers. I am a Royalist
in the first place, and then a Prussian and a German.
I will defend my King and the monarchy against revolution,
both overt and covert, and I will establish and
leave behind me a strong and healthy Germany. To
me the parties are a matter of indifference. I am also
not a Conservative in the sense of the Conservative
party. My entire past as a Minister is evidence of that.
They saw that in 1873 in the question of the Inspection
of Schools Bill, when they turned their backs upon
me, attacked me in their papers, and wrote me absurd
letters.”</p>

<p>He took from the shelves near him a copy of a letter
with which he had disposed of an old gentleman in
Pomerania (Senfft-Pilsach), who had at that time warned
him to reflect and pray. This letter, which he read to
me, directed attention, <i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>, to the Psalms, chapter
12, verses 3 and 4: “The Lord shall cut off all
flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud
things: who have said, with our tongue will we prevail;
our lips are our own: who is lord over us?” He
then returned to the last elections, and observed: “The
defectiveness of our institutions is shown by the credulity
of the electors. It may come to this, that we shall
some day have to say of the German Constitution, after
all attempts at government and reform under it have
failed, as Schwarzenberg said at Olmütz: ‘This
arrangement has not stood the test.’ But that must
not be printed now. It is only for yourself.... They
have now invented another calumny. They take advantage
of my attachment to the Emperor, and pretend that
I am clinging to office, that I am devoured by the love
of power. It may turn out differently, however, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>
may say to them: ‘Here you have it! Now let us
see you govern!’ That, however, can only be after a
division on some important question, not on the
electoral returns. The Emperor is half inclined to try
it and let me go, if only for one session. Things
cannot go on as they are much longer. Of course, I am
not going to desert the Emperor; it would be unfair to
leave the old man in the lurch. But I cannot renounce
my convictions, and I will not have a return to the
period of conflict. I demand more appreciation and
better treatment.”</p>

<p>Returning once more to the statement that the
Liberal parties had been guilty of gross misrepresentation
during the last election, he added that they had at
the same time set the followers of the Government a
good example by their excellent organisation, energy, and
self-sacrifice. “Many people on our side, such as
Herzog, for instance, have also given a great deal of
money,” he said; “but the Progressists have done
more. They had all the treasure of the Hebrews
at their disposal, and were at the same time thoroughly
drilled and well organised.”</p>

<p>“And now,” he asked, “have I anything else for
you? Unruh has published various things that
should be refuted.” He took up the October number
of the sixth year’s issue of the <cite lang="de">Deutsche Revue</cite>, which
lay before him, and continued: “He maintains that he
has written for historians, but he obviously intended to
influence the elections. A great deal of it is erroneous,
other portions are electioneering lies, and some parts
require to be supplemented. Here, for instance, on
page 9, he states that while I was still a member of
Parliament I had a conversation with him which I concluded
with the words: ‘Now I tell you, if your party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>
is victorious, you shall take me under your wing, and if
my side gets the upper hand I will do as much for you.
Shake hands on it!’ This offer was actually made.
And curiously enough, a similar proposal was made to
me by d’Ester, the Radical member of Parliament. In
this case, however, I declined, and said: ‘If your party
wins, life will no longer be worth living, and if we have
the upper hand, then hanging shall be the order of the
day&mdash;but with all politeness, up to the very foot of
the gallows.’”</p>

<p>He turned over the leaves of the <cite lang="de">Revue</cite>, and continued:
“There is no foundation whatever for the
statement that the Opposition was not aware during the
years 1862 to 1866 that I had a strong anti-Austrian
policy in view. Besides, it is clear from Unruh’s own
‘Memoirs’ that they were fully informed respecting this
policy, and only offered opposition through hatred to
me, the Junker, and in consequence of their own
dogmatism. Here, on page 11, it is stated that shortly
after the outbreak of the Franco-Austrian War in 1859,
he had an interview with me at the Hotel Royal, when
I said to him that for Prussia to come to the assistance
of Austria would be an act of political suicide. I had
entirely lost my sympathy for Austria. If we did not
succeed in driving Austria out of Germany proper, and
if she kept the upper hand here, then our Kings would
once more be mere Electors and vassals of the
Hapsburgs. There could be no doubt as to the attitude
of the individual German Governments in case
of a crisis. With the exception perhaps of a few of
the minor States that fell within the sphere of Prussian
influence, all of them, if forced to make a choice, would
decide in favour of Austria. Prussia would, therefore,
be isolated, but there were circumstances in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span>
she might have the entire German people as her
allies.... Surely that was plain speaking, and it
ought not to have been difficult afterwards to recognise
the connection between such language and the increase
of the army. They would not see it, however....
On page 13 is another proof that they knew what I had
in view: ‘When the King went to Baden-Baden,
accompanied by the Ministers Von Auerswald and Von
Schleinitz, Bismarck followed him, evidently with the
object of continuing his efforts to prevent assistance
being rendered to Austria.’ And on the same page we
read: ‘There is another circumstance which strikes one
as an important piece of evidence to show that
Bismarck’s anti-Austrian policy, in so far as Austrian
influence in Germany was concerned, did not originate
in 1859, but was of older date. After 1866, speaking
in the House of Parliament to the former Landrath of
the Teltower district, I related to him my conversation
with Bismarck in 1859, whereupon he told me that
Bismarck had expressed the same anti-Austrian views
to him in 1854, and frankly confessed his anti-Austrian
policy. It was not until 1866, that is to say, twelve
years later, that it was practically applied. Bismarck
had therefore kept this plan of driving Austria out of
Germany before him all that time, and had resolutely
pursued it. This is of some importance in forming an
opinion upon the period of conflict.’ That is certainly
correct. And is it possible that what that Landrath in
1854 and Unruh in 1859 ascertained from me personally
had not also come to the knowledge of the others
and been present to their minds when they&mdash;the
Liberals&mdash;fought against me with the utmost violence
from 1862 to 1866?”</p>

<p>The Chancellor turned over a few further pages, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span>
then continued: “With regard to the situation in the
autumn of 1862, Unruh was convinced (page 15) that
‘if Bismarck desired to put an end to dualism in
Germany, it was obviously impossible to do so without a
war with Austria, and that for this purpose it was
necessary to make the Prussian army as strong as
possible.’ That is therefore what I have already told
you. In October (page 16), during a general meeting
of the National Union at Coburg, he communicated the
conversation of 1859 to a confidential circle. He writes:
‘I told my old Prussian and my new German friends that
they were quite mistaken in regarding Bismarck as a
simple Reactionary or indeed as an instrument of reaction.
He was certainly not a Liberal, but he had
quite different ideas and plans in his head to those
entertained by Manteuffel and his colleagues.’ The
gentlemen were in doubt, and wanted to wait and see
how I acted. In 1863 they would appear to have
acquired the conviction (page 18) that I had given up
my schemes of foreign policy, and was now nothing
more than a reactionary Minister&mdash;of foreign policy,
because (as they inferred by a most extraordinary process
of reasoning) in the interval there had been in domestic
affairs political persecution, measures against Liberal
officials, restrictions on the liberty of the press, and
attacks upon the freedom of speech in Parliament.
But what in the world had that to do with my foreign
policy, and the belief in my anti-Austrian schemes?
Moreover, on the next page, one ascertains that at this
period Unruh &amp; Co. had received an assurance from
a trustworthy source that I had a struggle with the
Austrians in view. The writer of the ‘Memoirs’ reports:
‘Seidel, who was at that time Chief Burgomaster of
Berlin, made me a communication which he said came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span>
from the Military Cabinet, of which General von
Manteuffel was the head. According to this communication
either Manteuffel or some one who was in
intimate relations with him had said that Bismarck was
exceptionally well fitted for the task of stamping out
the Opposition in Parliament, and that when he had
succeeded in doing that and the military organisation
was secured, he must be set aside as he would otherwise
bring about a war with Austria, and would use our
increased military forces for that purpose. A conflict
with Austria and a successful war against her would
again drive the Conservative party from office. In
order to keep the Conservatives in power it was necessary
that Prussia should remain on good terms with Austria,
and for that purpose they should even, if necessary,
make concessions. This statement (Unruh goes on to
say) looked highly probable. General Manteuffel was
known as the head of the extreme Conservative or so-called
Austrian party at the Prussian Court, and was
much esteemed in Vienna. Bismarck had given frequent
expression to his anti-Austrian plans even before he
became Premier, and had indeed submitted them to the
King himself. If Bismarck were to bring about a compromise
with Parliament, and to conclude a peace with
the popular representatives, his services, in the opinion
of the Manteuffel party, would be of no further use,
and he ought then to go. It would be quite different
if in spite of the violent struggle with Parliament, he
succeeded in carrying through the military organisation
scheme. So long as the conflict with the popular
representatives continued, he remained indispensable,
his value increasing with the fierceness of the
struggle.’</p>

<p>“This is a tissue of mistakes and contradictions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span>
In the first place there is no foundation whatever for
the statement that Manteuffel wished to get rid of me,
and that he was the head of the Austrian party. It
was rather Schleinitz who held that position, and who
afterwards was in frequent intercourse with the Austrians,
his salon indeed being their rendezvous. Manteuffel
was by no means a partisan of Austria, but on the contrary
a Prussian officer of ardent Royalist patriotism.
But in that case one would have thought that if the
Opposition in the Diet had been imbued with Prussian
patriotism, if they had desired to see the dualism in
Germany put an end to and the German idea realised
through Prussia, they ought to have supported me with
all their might, knowing as they did that I had exactly
the same object in view. And that would also have
been wise from their Liberal standpoint, since it was
of course known that a victory over Austria would drive
the Conservatives from power. Finally, there was no
reason to apprehend my overthrow by the Austrophil
Conservatives, as, according to Unruh himself, it was
known that I possessed the confidence of the King, who,
it was indeed said, had himself called me his spiritual
doctor. The Opposition, however, instead of acting on
such considerations, adopted a diametrically opposite
course. They acted in an unpractical, illogical, impolitic
way, and against their own interests, blinded by their
stupid animosity and pettifogging dogmatism. It was
necessary for the Liberals, if they desired to pursue a
practical policy, to win for their cause&mdash;which could not
be promoted without driving Austria out of the Confederation&mdash;the
support of the King of Prussia, who had
scruples as to a conflict with Austria, scruples which
were encouraged by a section of his <i lang="fr">entourage</i>. King
William should have been gradually convinced of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>
necessity of breaking with the Vienna policy, and of
attempting to give Prussia alone the leading position in
Germany. I pursued this end, and Parliament should
have done the same. Instead of doing so, however, they
flew in the face of the King by refusing him the means
for the reorganisation of the army, and they therefore
lacked the necessary leverage for promoting their
own views. There they were, floating in the air, with
nothing to sustain them but the wind of their own
speeches and self-conceit which deluded them into a
belief in their own importance.</p>

<p>“Finally, Unruh says here (page 19) that I aggravated
the struggle over the Military Bills into a
constitutional conflict, that I assumed an aggressive
attitude towards the Opposition, and endeavoured in
almost every speech to incense them by jibes and
sneers, all this for the sole purpose of maintaining
myself in power and office against the Austrophil Court
party; and, on page 20, he repeats the same charge
in the following words: ‘I am still of opinion that
Bismarck used and took advantage of the conflict to
maintain and strengthen his position.’ Now that is
a gross slander, such as would render a man liable to
prosecution&mdash;a falsehood arising from the same blindness
as another on page 16, according to which
the great men of the National Union regarded me
merely as the representative of reaction. I desired no
reaction, then as little as now, when I am again charged
with doing so. Had I desired it I could have had it.
Unruh and his colleagues would not have been able to
prevent it, and ‘The People’ who elected them, could
have done nothing. But it was not the people. The
determined attitude I adopted towards the Opposition
in Parliament was just as little due to the love of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>
power, or to the desire to strengthen my ministerial
position. It was rather due to my innate Royalism,
which has always been a leading feature in my character.
It was this which made me hold fast to my position.
In doing so I was guided by my sense of duty towards
my King, who, in the circumstances then obtaining,
could not have found another Minister. I remember
saying to him, ‘No one shall have it in his power to say
that your Majesty cannot find a servant so long as there
is one nobleman of the Altmark still surviving.’ Otherwise,
at that time, it was, honestly speaking, no pleasure
to be a Minister. A Legation in Paris, or even in
Frankfurt, would have been much pleasanter. There one
had a good salary with little work, little responsibility,
and little worry, and was not attacked and reviled on
all hands. The provocation and the sarcastic speeches
in Parliament, of which Unruh complains, were not
intended to prolong or aggravate the conflict, but were
an exercise of the <i lang="la" title="an eye for an eye">jus talionis</i>. I am stated on page 17
to have often been most offensive. There is no denying
that. But even when my expressions were offensive,
they were not nearly so offensive as the language used
against me and other members of the Government by
speakers in the House. They were much coarser and
more malicious than I ever was, indeed actually abusive
and threatening, speaking of ‘a Ministry of tight-rope
dancers,’ of ‘the reactionary brand of Cain,’ and other unflattering
epithets. I was not the man to submit to that
sort of thing. It was not in my nature to turn the left
cheek to the smiter. On the contrary, I defended myself
and paid them back in their own coin. Then, in addition
to that, there was my contempt for the doctrine of
popular sovereignty, and my disgust at the Byzantine
veneration paid to it by the Opposition. That was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>
abomination to me, and revolted me even more than
their venom.</p>

<p>“The passage here on page 22, as to the motives of
my attitude on the question of the payment of members
in the North German Diet is amusing, and indeed
ludicrous. Unruh says: ‘At that time I was still in
favour of payment, but said to Bennigsen I did not
believe that Bismarck would give way; perhaps it was
entirely out of his power to do so. It seemed to me as
if he had entered into binding engagements with the
Upper House, which he expected later on to swallow
universal suffrage, when the several States had given
their necessary approval to the North German Constitution.’
With the Upper House! A body which always
stood apart from active politics, and had no influence of
any importance. An absurd idea!</p>

<p>“On page 24 he recalls a remark made by Loewe,
that one of the chief defects of the German Constitution
is that it was made after my own heart. Now, that is
a mere phrase which no amount of reiteration in party
newspapers and speeches during the last few years has
brought any nearer to truth.</p>

<p>“On page 25 he says: ‘As far back as 1867 it must
have become clear to every person of insight that there
was no possibility of Parliamentary government under
Bismarck. An essential condition of such government
is that in certain circumstances there should be a
change of ministers and parties capable of furnishing
and supporting a Cabinet.’ This is quite true. ‘Parties
capable of furnishing and supporting a Cabinet’&mdash;where
were they to be found during the past two decades? I
have seen none, neither one with a majority nor one
with a positive programme. And, least of all, in the
Liberal camp. All their manifestoes and speeches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span>
have consisted merely of fault-finding criticism and
negation. They have never brought forward anything
positive. They have only a thirst for office, ambition
and envy, but not the power which is essential to
productive government.</p>

<p>“On the same page he says: ‘Almost all parties, in
so far as they are not hostile to German unity, consider
the Imperial Chancellor to be absolutely indispensable.’
And yet from 1877 onwards I have been subjected to
the most bitter hostility even from the National Liberals,
and before and during the last elections the Progressist
party gave out the watchword ‘Away with Bismarck!’</p>

<p>“The statement which immediately follows is also
a mere hackneyed phrase: ‘A party which has no
principles of its own, but only aims at securing a
majority for the Government, affords no reliable support
in critical and dangerous times.’ One would like to
know why. Does the Opposition with its Liberalism
perhaps offer such support, with its untrustworthiness,
its suspiciousness, and vacillation, its huckstering and
knuckling down, and its petty criticism and dogmatism?</p>

<p>“On page 29 it is represented as a matter of indifference
whether the idea of a Zollverein Parliament
was originated by me or by Delbrück. I take it that this
ought not to be a matter of indifference to Unruh, who
claims to provide materials for future historians. The
idea did not come from Delbrück, but from me. As can
be seen from Hesekiel’s book, I mooted it as far back
as the time when I was in St. Petersburg, and embodied
it in the treaties of 1866, which secured its fulfilment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
But he, as a Liberal and a member of the learned
classes, must of course get the credit of having first
originated it, not a Junker. I do not wish to say
anything against Delbrück’s ability and merit, but it
would never have occurred to him that the Zollverein
could be turned to account in that way, for although
he had a great deal of talent, he had no political
instinct.</p>

<p>“On page 30 Unruh states: ‘During the debate on
the Tobacco Taxation Bill, when Bismarck had declared
a monopoly to be his ideal, Bennigsen informed me that
he had broken off the negotiations into which he had
entered with Bismarck in the autumn for joining the
Ministry, and had told him that he could not commit
himself to the monopoly.’ That is not true, or at
least only half true. This is how the matter stood.
In 1877 Eulenburg wished to retire. I offered his post
to Bennigsen. He demanded that Forckenbeck and
Stauffenberg should also be appointed Ministers, but
there were no posts vacant for them. In the meantime
Eulenburg hit upon another idea. He went to
the King and incited him against me for having had
anything to do with Bennigsen. His Most Gracious
was offended, and in a brutal letter forbade me to treat
any further with Bennigsen. Several months passed,
during which time it transpired in the press that Lasker
also counted upon a seat in the Cabinet. Bennigsen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span>
came to me subsequently in the Reichstag, an unusual
thing for him to do, and inquired about the tobacco
monopoly. I replied that I was in favour of it and
would try to carry it, whereupon Bennigsen declared
that he could not support the measure, and withdrew
from the negotiations. Out of politeness I forbore
to tell him that he was no longer in my mind, as I
had been forbidden to think of him.</p>

<p>“Further on Unruh says: ‘From that time forward
there was an obvious change in the attitude of the
Imperial Chancellor towards the National Liberals.’
That is incorrect. The contrary is the case. From
that time forward the National Liberals treated me
with mingled coolness and hostility, withdrawing their
support in the Diet and attacking me in their newspapers&mdash;chiefly
in the <cite lang="de">National Zeitung</cite>, which is the
most mendacious of them all, full of hypocrisy and
trickery.</p>

<p>“On page 31 Delbrück’s free-trade system is
spoken of as having been for a long time in
force. The question here is what is meant by ‘a
long time.’ The system which is here named after
Delbrück has only been in existence since 1865, and we
first began to entertain serious doubts respecting it in
1875. Up to the latter date I had had no time to
think of its advantages or disadvantages, as I was
obliged to devote my whole mind to watching and
averting the serious danger of coalition which then
existed.</p>

<p>“On page 32 there is a falsehood obviously calculated
to influence the elections. I am made to say
that I wished to ‘drive the National Liberals to the
wall,’ while people heard at the same time that I intended
to make a complete change in the previous
customs and commercial policy. This is impossible. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
first thought of the latter in November last; and to
‘drive to the wall’ is an expression which I have never
used, either in this connection or in any other. It is
not to be found in my lexicon. Every one knows
whether he is apt to use a certain phrase or not, and I
am quite satisfied that I have never used that phrase.</p>

<p>“The dissolution of the Reichstag after the Nobiling
outrage is represented as a measure directed against the
Liberals. It was in reality the very opposite, an act of
complaisance on the part of the Government towards
the Liberals. I wished to make the change of opinion
with regard to the Anti-Socialist laws easy for them by
means of a dissolution and new elections. But that is
the way with these gentlemen and their excessive
<i lang="fr">amour propre</i>. If one does not always stand hat in
hand before them, they regard one as their enemy, and
full of arrogance. But I cannot do that. I do not set
much store by criticisms and speeches intended for the
newspapers. Indeed, I lack altogether the bump of
veneration for my fellow man.”</p>

<p>At this moment Theiss announced the Minister
Maybach. I rose, and putting under my arm the
number of the <cite lang="de">Revue</cite> which he had given me with his
grey, red, and blue pencil marks and comments, was
about to leave. Before going, however, I said: “Might
I venture to ask whether Gambetta has called upon you,
Serene Highness?” “No,” he replied. “He has said
so himself, and it is the fact. Of course it is evident
from his journey to Danzig that he had thought of
paying a visit to Varzin. He doubtless reconsidered
the matter there, or they may have written to him from
Paris that it would not make a good impression.” On
Maybach coming in at this point the Chancellor said:
“We were just speaking of Gambetta. It was
not my business to deny the report of his visit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>
me. People might have thought that I had some
grudge against him&mdash;that I wished to hold aloof
from him, which was not at all the case.”</p>

<p>I took my leave and immediately wrote down what
I had heard. The first part respecting the results of the
elections was worked up into an article entitled “The
Chancellor Crisis,” which appeared in No. 48 of the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>; the criticism of the Unruh Memoirs being
utilised for an article in No. 49.</p>

<p>After I had received copies of these and of a third
article, “The Imperial Chancellor and the Reichstag,”
I handed over all three at the palace at noon on the
2nd of December for delivery to the Prince. An hour
later I received the following letter from the Imperial
Chancellerie, signed by Sachse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Under instructions from the Imperial Chancellor
I have the honour to request you to call upon his
Serene Highness to-day at any time up to 5 o’clock.
The Imperial Chancellor mentioned at the same time
that the articles which you have submitted to him
cannot possibly be published in their present form.”</p>
</div>

<p>I presented myself at the palace at 3 o’clock,
but could not see the Chancellor, as Prince William was
with him, and Mittnacht, the Minister, was announced
to follow. On my returning again at 4 o’clock
Mittnacht was with the Chief, but left in about ten
minutes. Immediately afterwards the Chancellor sent
me word that he was waiting for me in the garden. On
my passing through the door of the large antechamber,
I found him standing outside with his dog. He shook
hands in a friendly way, saying immediately afterwards,
however: “But what have you been doing, Doctor?
Why, that is all wrong, the very opposite of what I
wanted. Surely the article is not yet printed?” I regretted
that it was already published. “That is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>
unfortunate,” he rejoined. I asked which of the articles
he meant. “Why, that about Unruh,” he answered.
“You have said exactly what Bennigsen asserted. It
might have been written by one of my worst enemies.
And the other is also not correct&mdash;often pure nonsense.
I remember it was just the same three years ago with
the things you sent on to me to Kissingen and Gastein&mdash;in
many places the direct contrary was the truth.” I
replied that that was only the case in one instance, in
the story about Rechberg, which was then left out.
He would not agree to that, however, and continued:
“You must submit these articles to me before they are
printed. You now trust too much to your memory, which
is not so good as it was formerly, or you have not listened
attentively. I related it all to you quite differently.”</p>

<p>At this point we were interrupted by Count Bill, who
brought a message. When he had gone the Chief took
the article out of his pocket, and as it had grown dark
we passed through another door into his study, where he
looked through the passage once more. At the first, on
page 395, where I&mdash;following Unruh’s statement&mdash;made
the Chief say that in the year 1859 the German Governments
“with the exception of a few minor States
which fall within the sphere of influence of Prussia,
would all join Austria. The former would, therefore, be
completely isolated, yet she would have allies if she
knew how to win and to treat them, namely the German
people,” he said: “That’s pure nonsense. Directly contrary
to history. Why, you should have known that....
But, no, I misunderstood the sentence. I read it
wrongly in my hurry. The ‘former’ and ‘she’ referred
to Prussia. There I have done little Busch (Büschchen)
an injustice.... But further on, here (the passage on
398) where I say that the people could have done nothing
against a reactionary policy during the period of conflict.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>
That is unfounded. I cannot say that. It should
have been ‘would have done nothing.’ No doubt they
would have desired to do it. Well, on page 401, that is
again an oversight on my part. Here I overlooked the
first ‘not.’” (He referred to the passage: “The expression
‘drive them to the wall’ has not only not been used
by me in this connection, but was never used by me at
all.”) “But all this about Bennigsen is quite wrong&mdash;the
second part of it. There you have written in his
interest. If that were a correct account I should have
told a lie. My main object in the article was to explain
that point, and you ought to have known from the
<cite lang="de">Norddeutsche</cite> how the matter really stood. You should
know that the article in that paper was written at my
instance. But I suppose you do not read the official
journals. No further negotiations took place with him
after the interview at Varzin, that is with Bennigsen
respecting the ministerial post, although I did not break
with him otherwise. It is true that my son wrote to
him once more, but I knew nothing of this. And Eulenburg
did not decide to remain. He had had enough of
it. He went to the King, however, told him of my
negotiations with Bennigsen, and incited him against me.
I had been in treaty with these Liberals behind his back,
&amp;c. The King did not inform me that Eulenburg did
not wish to retire, but wrote me an exceedingly rude and
snappish letter somewhat to this effect: How dare I
enter into negotiations with this rabid Radical, this arch-demagogue,
and expressly forbade me to treat with him
any further. That did not take place ‘several months,’
but only three or four days after the Varzin interview.
The statement that Lasker reckoned on obtaining a portfolio
is correct. On the other hand it is quite incorrect
to say that <em>out of politeness</em> I abstained from telling
Bennigsen that I did not think of him any more, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
post was no longer open. It was still open, as you might
have seen in any calendar. Surely you know that
Friedenthal only held it provisionally. The truth is I
could not explain to Bennigsen that his Most Gracious
had forbidden me to negotiate with him any further.”</p>

<p>While speaking thus the Chancellor underlined the
passage referred to, page 400, lines 19 to 28, in so far as
he had corrected them, adding notes of exclamation and
remarks such as “No,” and “three days.” I expressed
my regret at the harm that had been done and observed
that it could be put right in the next number of the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>. He agreed to this and wished to see the correction
before it appeared. I promised to submit it to
him. Finding in the course of his examination, that the
misfortune did not extend to more than some five lines
in an article of nine pages, his excitement gradually subsided.
Indeed, the “Büschchen” at the beginning had
already sounded less severe, and at the close he said “I
must have a breath of fresh air before dinner. Come
along!”</p>

<p>We strolled up and down in the park for about an
hour longer, and spoke of other matters. I congratulated
the Prince on the success with which he had repelled the
attacks of his opponents in the Reichstag three or four
days previously. “Yes, successfully,” he rejoined.
“That’s very fine, but what good has it done? They
have, all the same, refused the 80,000 marks for an
adviser on political economy; and the Government has
now no means of keeping itself informed.” I remarked
that they had obviously been influenced by their own
ignorance of practical affairs, and particularly with industrial
matters, as well as by jealousy and fear. Bamberger’s
assertion that they knew enough themselves was
no proof of the contrary. They wished to appear before
the public as the only infallible wiseacres, and also being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span>
doctrinarians, they could afford to ignore economic
facts.</p>

<p>We then spoke about Windthorst, of whom the
Chief said: “His vote against the Government has
destroyed the slight degree of confidence I was beginning
to feel in him.” The conversation then turned upon
Bennigsen’s Parliamentary activity, and I remarked on
the striking circumstance that up to the present he had
taken no part in any of the debates. The Prince rejoined:
“It is very sensible on his part to keep silent,
although he is a good speaker. He sent the others to
the front&mdash;Benda, and he also voted against it&mdash;a further
proof that he and his party are quite untrustworthy.
He has no decided views, he is not frank, and he is afraid
of Lasker. With him it is always vacillation and half
measures. Do you play cards?” I replied in the negative.
“But you know the cards?” “Yes.” “Now, at
whist he always keeps three aces in his hand, and gives
no indication that he holds them. He can no longer be
counted upon, and besides his followers have been
greatly reduced owing to their vague and vacillating
policy. Nevertheless, he still sits there with the same
high opinion of himself and the same dignified air as
formerly when he commanded hundreds; and he will
continue to do so even if they should be reduced to
thirteen, like George Vincke’s Old Liberals. There is
nothing to be done with the others either. It has now
come to pass, through the absurdities of the Liberals,
that the tag, rag and bobtail, the Guelphs, Poles, and
Alsacians, the Social Democrats, and the People’s Party,
turn the scale, putting those they support in the majority.
Mittnacht, who was with me before you came, is of the
same opinion. In future we shall have to count upon
the Governments rather than upon the Reichstag, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span>
indeed, we may ultimately have to reckon upon the
Governments alone.”</p>

<p>I said that the whole Parliamentary system would in
time lose all credit, even with the public, through such
senseless attacks and votes. It brought everything to a
standstill, but was itself unable to produce anything
better. “The effect of the recent debates,” I went on,
“is already here and there observable. This morning I
met Thile, who stopped me and asked what I thought of
the Parliamentary struggle. He was immensely pleased
with the attitude you had adopted. A friend of his,
whom he did not wish to name, but who was an admirer
of the new era, though up to the present by no means
favourable to you, had said that the manner in which you
spoke and repelled the attacks of the Opposition was
simply magnificent, and excited universal admiration.
And women speak with disgust of the way in which you
were hounded down and personally insulted by the Progressists
and Lasker. A Hanoverian lady, of Guelph
sympathies, spoke to my wife yesterday in this sense.
This disgust and this pity for you will gradually affect
the men, and help to bring about a change in the present
tendency. I myself feel no pity, I only foresee your
triumph. Pray excuse me for comparing you to an
animal, but you remind me of the picture of a noble
stag, which time after time shakes off the snarling pack,
and then, proud and unhurt, regains the shelter of his
forest, crowned by his branching antlers.” “Yes,” he
said, “one might take another animal, the wild boar,
which gores the hounds and tosses them away from
him.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, and as we walked up and
down he hummed the tune “Wir hatten gebauet ein
stattliches Haus.” He then remarked suddenly: “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>
if they go on in that style they will ultimately meet the
fate to which I alluded&mdash;the Luck of Edenhall. You
know Uhland’s poem? It will be a case of Bang! and
snap goes the German Constitution! You spoke of
Thile. Do you mean the former Secretary of State?”
I said “Yes, I meet him sometimes as he lives in
my neighbourhood.” “He is a dangerous man,” he
observed. “He was quite incapable. He could do
nothing, and wrote nothing, because he was afraid it
would be corrected; and yet I kept him for ten years,
although he conspired against me with Savigny. He is
to blame for the Diest libels, which led to the prosecution.
I heard the whole story and how it began from
Rothschild. Savigny went to him about the promotion
of the company in question, and asked him if he could
not let him have a share in it. Rothschild said no, he
had already been obliged to part with a large share, a
million and a half&mdash;meaning to his branches, the houses
with which he is associated. Savigny, however,
thought he was alluding to me, and would appear to
have hinted something of the kind, but Rothschild
seems either not to have understood him, or not to
have answered with sufficient clearness. Savigny then
carried the tale further, telling it first to Thile, who
mentioned it to his brother, the general, instead of
speaking to me, his chief, and in this way Diest ultimately
came to hear of it. But, as Minister, I have never done
any business with Rothschild, and even as envoy at
Frankfurt very little. I drew my salary through him,
and on one occasion I exchanged some stock for Austrian
securities. I have not found it necessary. My profession
as Minister has brought me in something, and
through the grants and the gift of the Lauenburg estates
I have become a rich man. It is true that if I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>
gone into a business, or carried on a trade, and devoted
to it the same amount of labour and intelligence, I
should doubtless have made more money.”</p>

<p>We then returned once more to the recent debates
in the Reichstag, and I again expressed in strong terms
the contempt I felt for the Opposition. “You were
always a gentleman pitted against vain and vulgar
creatures,” I said, “and in saying that I am not thinking
of your rank as a Prince.” “No, I understand&mdash;a
gentleman in my way of thinking,” he rejoined.
“Lasker’s Jewish forwardness and presumption,” I
continued, “the Professors with their priggish airs of
superiority, and their empty pathos; Hänel, the self-complacent
and pathetic doctrinaire&mdash;it is impossible
to imagine anything more repulsive. He wanted to be
Minister of Justice in ‘sea-surrounded Schleswig-Holstein.’”
“Yes,” said the Chancellor, interrupting me,
“they had divided the parts among themselves before
the piece had been secured, and they probably have done
the same thing now. Nothing came of it, however,
after the interview which our Most Gracious had with
me upstairs in the yellow chamber, where he remained
with me from 9 o’clock until near midnight.” “And
where he heard the simile of the chickens in Low
German,” I added. “And then that impudent, lying,
clown Richter, and the whole tearing, snarling, sprawling
pack face to face with simple, solid, positive greatness.
It was as if you belonged to an entirely different
species.” “Yes,” he said, “when I lie down in bed
after such debates, I feel ashamed of ever having
bandied words with them. You know the way one
feels after a night’s drinking, if one has had a row and
perhaps come to blows with vulgar people&mdash;when one
begins to realise it next morning, one wonders how and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span>
why it all came about.” Then after I had promised to
make the corrections immediately and send them to him,
he took leave of me with the words “Good evening,
Busch. Auf Wiedersehen.” Busch! Not “Herr
Doctor” as usual.</p>

<p>In two hours I sent him the corrections, which I
received back through a Chancery attendant before
10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> There were only a few alterations in the second
half.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of January, 1882, I again visited
Bucher. He complained in general of the incapable
<i lang="fr">entourage</i> of the Prince, including his sons, and of
Rudolf Lindau, whom they favoured because he gave
card parties and made himself useful to them in other
ways. (...) He was a mere tradesman without
education or political knowledge. The Prince wished to
make things comfortable for himself, and no blame to
him, but he was mistaken if he thought the machine
would still go on working as it ought to. In that
respect the choice of the <i lang="fr">personnel</i> was of importance,
and those who were now engaged, particularly in the
press department, were almost constantly blundering.
The stuff which Paul Lindau wrote for the <cite lang="de">Kölnische
Zeitung</cite> was also of little value.</p>

<p>We then spoke about the negotiations with the
Curia, which were making satisfactory progress; of
Held’s contribution to the social history of England;
of Taine’s account of the Jacobins, in whom Bucher
discovered some characteristics of the Progressist party;
of Stirum, who had also left because he was not disposed
to put up with the intrigues of the clique that surrounded
the Prince, and who had told him, Bucher, that he
“preferred in future to admire the Chancellor at a
distance”; and of the Chief’s recent criticism of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span>
article. I said that the Chief must be mistaken in asserting
that after the visit to Varzin he had had no further
negotiations with Bennigsen respecting his joining the
Ministry, as he had himself told me that at that time
Herbert had written to Bennigsen, which he would
scarcely have ventured to do without his father’s knowledge.
Bucher agreed with me, and added that some one
had expressed the opinion that Bennigsen had acted like
a gentleman with regard to the statements published by
the semi-official press. Bucher arranged to send me
Taine’s book when he had finished reading it, in order
that I might write an article upon it. He is extracting
passages which point to the similarity between the
Jacobins and the Progressist party.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 8th of January, Count
William Bismarck sent me an article for the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
on “Agricultural Credit in Prussia.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>On Monday, the 16th of January, I took back the
third volume of Taine’s <cite>History of the Revolution</cite>, <cite lang="fr">La
Conquête des Jacobins</cite>, to Bucher. He told me that
according to a conversation with the Chief, a campaign
would presently be opened in the press in order to
clear up some points respecting Stockmar and Bunsen.
He was to write a pamphlet on the latter in which
various documents, of which only portions were given in
Frau von Bunsen’s book, would be published <i lang="la" title="at full length">in extenso</i>.
I could then make myself useful by utilising this information,
in addition to which he would give me further
material. We then spoke of the Coburg clique, of
Abeken, who had been described on one occasion by
Bunsen as the “magnificent Abeken,” of Max Müller of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>
Oxford, with whom he had spent some pleasant hours,
of Geffcken, and finally of Hepke. On my asking how it
was that the latter had fallen into disfavour with the
Prince, Bucher said that in 1862, shortly after the
Chief had come into office, Hepke, who had charge of
the German reports, reproduced, almost literally, in a
brochure which he published under the title of “A Word
from a Prussian,” a memorandum which Bismarck had
submitted to the King. Although this pamphlet was
anonymous, the Chief came to hear of it, and forbade
Metzler to mention it in our papers. Then, again,
shortly before the war of 1866, Hepke, “through vanity,
in order to show how well informed he was,” communicated
some scheme that was in hand against Austria to
the Austrian Envoy, probably at dinner, and this came
to the knowledge of the Chief later on, after our
reconciliation with Austria, most likely through
Rechberg.</p>

<p>I then turned the conversation on Thile, mentioning
what the Prince recently said to me. Bucher still
maintained that Thile is a gentleman and very good-hearted,
and questioned whether he were as incapable as
Bismarck had described him to me.</p>

<p>On the 26th of January, Bucher sent me the first
and third volumes of Nippold’s edition of Bunsen’s
biography, the proof sheets of a refutation by him of a
letter from Prince Albert to Stockmar, explaining
Bunsen’s “fall” (which was published first in the
<cite lang="de">Münchener Nachrichten</cite>, and afterwards in the <cite lang="de">National
Zeitung</cite>), and finally some rough notes for a <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
article, which I prepared and published by the 2nd of
February in No. 8, under the title “Bunsen’s Friends
and the Truth.” Bucher’s refutation was to appear in
the February number of the <cite lang="de">Deutsche Revue für das<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span>
gesammte National-Leben der Gegenwart</cite>. In the
rough notes he spoke as follows of Bunsen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“He took away with him copies of official documents,
(just like Arnim), which his family published in
a mutilated and therefore falsified shape. You may
indeed without hesitation throw out the suggestion
whether he did not perhaps take the originals. He did,
as a matter of fact, take away at least three. This
whole section of the book (<i lang="la"><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, of the biography, so far
as it relates to Bunsen’s retirement) is a fable, written
in despite of the author’s better knowledge. That the
King afterwards wrote him a friendly letter, &amp;c.
is explained by the distinction which Frederick William
IV. was in the habit of drawing between the official and
the friend, as in the case of Radowitz. The Memorandum
is a schoolboy’s exercise. Austria to extend
her borders as far as the Sea of Azof, Poland to
be restored&mdash;a terrible suggestion to be so coolly
uttered&mdash;Prussia to get Austrian Silesia, one of
the Provinces most devoted to the Imperial House, and
Moravia!</p>

<p>“Vol. <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> p. 557. His views concerning the proper
preparatory education for the diplomatic service. That
did not succeed in the case of Theodore (one of Bunsen’s
sons). He must have achieved something out of
the common at Lima and Alexandria, since after a short
stay at these places he was on each occasion superseded,
and had ultimately to resign. If he had had the preliminary
training which he scoffed at, instead of a mere
professorial education, he would probably not have been
guilty of the follies and insubordination of the 1st and
4th of March 1854.</p>

<p>“You will find particulars as to the æsthetic International
in the index at the end of the third volume.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>
You are better versed in the religious type of humanity
than I am. Every third word is God. Bunsen seems
to have considered that the <i lang="de" title="dear God">lieber Gott</i> took quite a
special interest in him.</p>

<p>“A <i lang="fr">bon mot</i> which circulated in London: The learned
regarded him as a diplomat while the diplomatists
believed him to be a <i lang="fr">savant</i>. The self-flattery in the
account of the conversation with Clarendon, Part <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>
Bunsen and Pourtales certify to each other’s excellences.
The source of Albert’s letter, Part <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> page 356. Bunsen
complains of his Government to Albert.</p>

<p>“A popular explanation of the political side of the
book will doubtless be also necessary for the dull-witted
Philistine. Prussia should involve herself in war with
Russia, and what was to be the compensation? 1. That
the English fleet should enter the Baltic. This would
mean at least, that the Prussian coasts would be protected
against the Russian fleet. 2. That the four
Plenipotentiaries (of the Vienna Conference) should
announce Prussia’s community of interest in the overthrow
of Russian predominance. Much good that
would have done us! How often has the integrity of
Turkey been declared to be a European interest? And
the idea of an Anglo-Prussian alliance (the Old Liberal
dogma) which so frequently crops up in the book is
equally absurd, and shows a complete ignorance of
English policy, which never enters into permanent
alliances without positive and limited aims. Part <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>
201 and 207.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 2nd of February I again called upon Bucher.
He gave me various further particulars respecting the
“great patriot and meritorious diplomatist,” Bunsen,
and his sons. The old gentleman’s chief reason for
tendering his resignation so hastily was that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span>
about to take his holiday after the catastrophe, he was
not paid his full salary as an envoy for six months, as
he had demanded, but only for six weeks, as provided
by the regulations. Theodore, whom Bunsen described
to Thile as the most gifted of his sons, had made
himself impossible at Lima, by his tactlessness in
holding intercourse with the Opposition party, and
using his influence on their behalf. He afterwards held
the post of envoy at Stockholm, which he resigned
when the Government refused him leave to marry a
very wealthy German-Russian lady from the Baltic
Provinces. He now enjoys possession of this lady.
Another son has a fat benefice in England. “Frau
Schwabe,” the “Elpi’s Melena” of the newspapers,
who is frequently mentioned in the Nippold edition
of the biography, is an enormously rich German Jewess,
widow of a manufacturer, and a friend, not only of
Bunsen, but also of Garibaldi, to whom she sent, after
he was wounded at Aspromonte, an artistic armchair in
“letter form,” that is to say, pasted all over with
postage stamps. Bucher expects that George von
Bunsen will reply to our articles. He, Bucher, will
then write an answer from further official documents,
for publication in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February I left a proof of my
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article on Bunsen at the Imperial Chancellor’s
palace for submission to the Prince. It was in an
envelope and signed “Moritz Busch,” but was accompanied
by no letter. I ascertained at the same
time from the porter that the Chancellor had not been
quite well for some time past. On my way back
through the Leipzigerstrasse I met Bucher, who was
delighted with “the fine goings-on in England now.”
I asked what he meant, and he replied: “Why, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>
Standing Orders in Parliament, the Closure. Our
people may well ask themselves whether they are
equally pleased with this new feature in their ideal.”</p>

<p>The extracts from Taine, properly grouped and
spiced with references to the German connections of the
Jacobins, namely the Progressists, appeared in Nos. 7
and 9 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> under the title “The True
Story of the Jacobins.” I also wrote an article on
Gladstone’s measure referred to by Bucher. This was
published in No. 10 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> under the title,
“Gladstone, and Liberty of Speech in Parliament.”</p>

<p>On the 10th of March I received the news of the
death of our son John, from Captain Alm of the <i>Dora
Ahrens</i> at Falmouth. He had died at sea on the 19th
of December last, on the return voyage from Corinto, in
Nicaragua. Falling overboard during a violent storm
in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands, he was unable
to hold on to the rope which was thrown to him, and
was swallowed up in the waves. With him, our only
son, disappeared my best love, my energy and pleasure
in work, my pride and my hope. Henceforth my life is
overshadowed by this grief. He was only thirty-one
years of age, had lived the hard life of the sailor, and
passed two severe examinations, so that we had reason
to hope that we should soon see him the captain of a
handsome craft. Now he lies at the bottom of a distant
sea, and all that remains of him is the memory of his
dear face and his brave, high-minded nature. Fearless,
truthful, and devoted to his duty, he died as he had
lived in the service of his ship, as the soldier dies for his
flag, his king and his country. He was a man, a
character, and death has no power over such! God has
further use of them. But we shall never see him again
with mortal eyes, and can only wreathe his portrait with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span>
laurels and forget-me-nots on his birthday, the 13th of
April.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="de">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Lass mich im düstern Reich,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All our friends manifested the greatest sympathy for
us, in which the Imperial Chancellor also did not fail to
join. He wrote me on the 16th of March:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have heard with sincere regret
of the heavy loss which you have suffered, and although
I have no consolation to offer in such circumstances,
I cannot refrain from expressing to you my heartfelt
sympathy.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Bismarck.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>With this these notes may be concluded. Evening
has set in.</p>


<p class="sp2">The sense of duty as a chronicler awoke again before
the pain of our loss had subsided. I again felt an
interest in other things besides the portrait of our dear
departed son, and so returned to my diary. The lines
dedicated to his memory shall remain, however, as a
monument to him, and a reminiscence of days full of
sorrow, and weeks of deep prostration and melancholy.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th of March I called upon
Bucher. He declared that the anti-German party in
Russia was growing dangerous, and though the Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>
appeared to be our sincere well-wisher, he would perhaps
be unable to withstand it. It was true that he had
spoken very sharply to Skobeleff who told Schweinitz,
as he was returning with him from Gatshina, that the
Emperor had severely reprimanded him (il m’a donné un
savon). The General actually looked depressed. A
Russian diplomatist (Nesselrode, if I understood rightly)
once said of Holstein when the latter was with
Bismarck in Petersburg years ago: “Ce jeune homme
sait une foule de choses, mais il n’est pas capable d’en
faire une seule.”</p>

<p>Pope Leo has shown great readiness to meet us half
way in personal questions. Among other things, he
had originally desired to appoint to the bishopric of
Osnabrück a former Jesuit and pupil of the Collegium
Germanicum, who had been recommended to him by
Tarnassi. But when our Government pointed out that
the candidate referred to had taken part in various
forms of anti-German agitation, the Pope unhesitatingly
dropped him.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May I met Thile in the Linkstrasse,
and accompanied him part of the way to his house. He
expressed his regret at our loss and his pleasure that the
Chief had likewise done so. The conversation then
turned on Hatzfeldt, and he said that Bismarck had
always favoured him, “pitying him for having such
a mother,” which, after all, was very nice on his part.
He had also dispensed with the diplomatic examination
in his case. Besides Hatzfeldt had talent and was good-hearted
in addition. As evidence of the latter he
mentioned that he frequently visited Goltz, who was
suffering from cancer of the tongue, although it was
scarcely possible to stand the atmosphere of the sick
room. He, Thile, had also repeatedly visited the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span>
sufferer. Bismarck, on the other hand, had never gone
to see him, although they had been on very friendly
terms formerly. “It was enough to turn one’s stomach,”
he said. It was true that subsequently, just before
Goltz had moved, the Chief called at the old lodgings,
and then gave as an excuse: “I was at his place but he
had left.” Thile then added the following characteristic
anecdote: “Of course you too are an old student of
Goethe, and remember the poem ‘Füllest wieder Busch
and Thal, still mit Nebelglanz.’ This was being recited
on one occasion, and when the reader came to the
passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="de">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Selig wer sich vor der Welt</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ohne Hass verschliesst,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Und mit dem geniesst.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(Blessed is he who retires, without hatred, from the
world, and enjoys his retreat in communion with a
single friend.) Bismarck exclaimed: ‘What! Without
hatred? What a tailor’s soul he must have!’” In
reply to my inquiry whether this story was absolutely
authentic, he mentioned Keudell as his authority.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 8th of June, three days after the
Chancellor’s return from Friedrichsruh, I left a note for
him at the palace in the Wilhelmstrasse, requesting him
if he had anything for me to do to name a day and
hour on which I should call for the necessary information.
At 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I had a letter from Sachse stating
that the Prince “wished to speak to me for a few
moments,” and requested me to call upon him next day
at 12.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I called at the time appointed, and after
waiting for about half an hour, while the Chief was
dictating to one of his deciphering clerks who wrote
shorthand, I was admitted to see him, and the “few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span>
minutes” extended to a full hour. The Prince was in
plain clothes, with the exception of military trousers.
He had grown thinner, so that his coat hung in folds
over his shoulders. Otherwise, however, he looked
well, and was evidently in good humour. He greeted
me with a shake hands and “Good day, Büschlein.”
Then, inviting me to sit down, he said: “You want
fodder, but I have none. There is nothing going on
either in domestic or foreign affairs. You recollect that
little bit of a Herzegovina, and now we have that little
bit of an Egypt. It is not of much concern to us,
although it certainly is to the English and also to the
French. They set about the affair in an awkward way,
and have got on a wrong track by sending their ironclads
to Alexandria, and now, finding that there is
nothing to be done they want the rest of Europe
to help them out of their difficulty by means of
a conference. Nothing can be done with the fleet
without a landing force, and this is not at hand, so that
it will be merely a repetition of the demonstration before
Dulcigno. In that case it was the rocks, here it is the
European warehouses, otherwise they would in all probability
have already bombarded the place. It is also a
question whether they would not have come off second
best, as the Egyptians have very heavy guns, and their
artillery is not bad. But so far as a conference is concerned,
it is like an inquiry round a board of green
cloth, the interests of the Powers are not the same, and
therefore it will not be easy to come to any practical
conclusion. The Sultan too will not co-operate. He is
not without justification in declining to do so. If he
can put things right by writing letters and sending
plenipotentiaries&mdash;which we shall know one of these
days&mdash;the Western Powers will have reason to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span>
thankful. If not there will be no alternative left but
for the Padishah to send his Nizams to restore order
there. That is due to the absurd policy which
Professor Gladstone has pursued from the beginning.
He tries to come to an understanding with France and
Russia, forgetting the fact that their interests in the
Levant are quite different to those of the English. He
surrendered all the valuable results which English
policy had tried to secure during the past eighty years
in its dealings with the Porte and with Austria, and
thought he could work miracles when he had offended
them both. And in France they have also taken a
wrong course out of consideration for public opinion.
Egypt is of the utmost importance to England on
account of the Suez Canal, the shortest line of communication
between the eastern and western halves of
the Empire. That is like the spinal cord which connects
the backbone with the brain. Any increase of Turkish
power does not affect England injuriously in this, or
indeed in any other respect. France thinks more of
the prestige to be gained by the Porte if it exercises a
mediating and controlling influence in the Egyptian
question, and fears that her own prestige in Africa
might suffer. Nevertheless, France has also very important
material interests there, since there are 14,000
Frenchmen in Egypt and only 3,000 English. It was
in vain for me to point out to them that an Arabian
Empire, such as Arabi may have in view, would be far
more dangerous to their position in Africa than any
strengthening of Turkish influence on the Nile. The
Porte is an old European landowner who is deeply in
debt, and who can always be reached and subjected to
pressure if he becomes too exacting. It is impossible
to foresee what effect an independent Egypt would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span>
upon the French position in Africa. That is doubtless
recognised by Freycinet, but he is afraid of the traditions,
prejudices and vanity of the French, and of
Gambetta, who manipulates them. It is true the
division in the Chamber turned out favourably, indeed
very much so, but even assuming that Gambetta cannot
return to power shortly, the wind may soon blow from
another quarter, and the understanding with England
come to an end. A campaign in co-operation with the
French, a military occupation, would be a hazardous
undertaking for the English, as the French could always
send more men than they, who require their soldiers in
Ireland, and who have altogether none too many. If
France had the larger force there she would of course
exercise more influence and play the leading part, and
it would perhaps be difficult to get her out of the
country again. The rest of us would not co-operate
in a military sense, as for the present the question is
one of comparative indifference to us, and it is no
business of ours to pull the chestnuts out of the fire
for other people, particularly for the English. So there
they are, with their ships, in a blind alley, and now
they want a conference to put the matter right. Here
also we are expected to come to their assistance, and
bring pressure to bear on the Porte, thus embroiling
ourselves with the Sultan&mdash;a suggestion which, of course,
we must politely decline.”</p>

<p>“Much in the same way,” I said, “as the English
before the last Russo-Turkish conflict wished you to
forbid the Russians entering upon hostilities, merely
because that did not suit England’s policy, and when
Queen Victoria wrote to you and the Emperor to that
effect.” “Yes,” he rejoined, “and it was the same
before the Crimean war, when Bunsen pleaded their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>
cause. They must manage to get out of the difficulties
into which they have plunged by themselves&mdash;having
made their bed they must lie on it.”</p>

<p>The dog, which had been standing behind me and
occasionally made his presence known by snarling, now
began to bark. “He notices that there is a stranger
outside,” said the Prince, who rang the bell and ordered
the attendant to keep the dog in the outer room. He
then continued: “In home affairs there is also nothing
of importance that you are not weary of. They will
reject the tobacco monopoly. There is no other course
open to them now.” “But, Serene Highness,” I said,
“you will submit it to them again, and carry it through
in three or four years’ time?” “That depends upon
circumstances,” he replied, “upon the future elections.
I have no intention of pressing the tobacco monopoly
out of a mere liking for this particular method of fiscal
reform. The monopoly is an evil, but it is still the
best of all available means of reform.... I first want
to get from them my certificate that I have done everything
in my power to do away with an unfair form of
taxation, but that they would not hear of it. Then
they may settle the matter with their electors and justify
their conduct, should it perhaps result in an increase
of the class tax (a form of direct taxation), while other
burdens cannot possibly be reduced.”</p>

<p>“Then one might as well emigrate,” I said.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he rejoined. “The class tax, which at
present is retained only in this country, is one of the
chief causes of emigration. If you only knew for how
many evictions it is responsible among the poorer and
indeed even among the middle classes! It is like the
Russian poll tax, and does not permit of any equitable
distribution of the burden in accordance with the condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span>
of those who have to bear it, while indirect taxation
distributes itself automatically. My object was to provide
a remedy for this and to lighten the burden of the
poorer citizens. That ought also to have been the
object of the Diet. But you have seen from the discussion
on the Appropriation Bill how little disposed
they are to do so; and Lingen’s motion, which was
adopted by the Commission, will not even admit the
necessity of a reserve.”</p>

<p>I observed: “The emphasis laid upon economy in
his motion is quite after the manner of the pedagogue,
and of the narrow-minded Philistine. It does not
sound as if it came from the Parliament of a great
empire, but rather as if the vestry of Little Peddlington
were casting the light of its wisdom upon the subject.
This petty huckstering spirit is characteristic of all
Liberalism. The majority of them are ‘snobs’ with a
sprinkling of ‘swells.’”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“That is true,” he said. “They certainly have not
much amplitude or breadth of view, and they are bent
on obstinate resistance to the Emperor’s message, in
which a far higher standpoint is adopted. But that is
their nature. They only think of their joint stock
companies, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, their Parliamentary parties, and whether
their shares will rise or fall if this or that is done or left
undone. They trouble their heads very little with anything
beyond that. Besides they hope that the old
Emperor will soon die and that his successor will give
them a free hand. The Emperor, however, does not at
all look as if he were going to oblige them. He may
live for a long time yet and indeed reach a hundred.
You should see how robust he is now, and how straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>
he holds himself! From what&mdash;(I understood, Lauer)
says, the Nobiling phlebotomy has been of benefit to
him, both physically and mentally, the old blood has
been drawn off, and he looks much less flabby than
formerly. We are now on good terms, better than we
have been for years.” “And the Successor will have to
follow the same course,” I said. “He cannot govern
differently without doing mischief.” “Oh, yes,” he
rejoined. “He also would like to retain me, but he is
too indolent, too much devoted to his own comfort and
thinks it would be easier to govern with majorities. I
said to him: ‘Try it, but I will not join in the experiment!’
Perhaps they are out in their reckoning
however, and a long-lived sovereign may be followed by
a short-lived one. It seems to me as if this might be
the case. He who would then ascend the throne is quite
different. He wishes to take the government into his
own hands; he is energetic and determined, not at all
disposed to put up with Parliamentary co-regents, a
regular guardsman!&mdash;Philopater and Antipater at
Potsdam! He is not at all pleased at his father taking
up with Professors, with Mommsen, Virchow and
Forckenbeck. Perhaps he may one day develop into
the <i lang="fr">rocher de bronze</i> of which we stand in need.”</p>

<p>He then came to speak of his other schemes of
reform, and observed: “The so-called Socialistic Bills
are in a tolerably fair way. They will force themselves
through, and develop further, even without me. The
most pressing and necessary measures will in the main
be soon carried. But it is unsatisfactory that they
should want to bring the funds for the relief of the
sick into too close connection with the insurance scheme.
In this case it is not advisable that the payments in
kind should be transformed into money payments.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span>
He then gave a technical explanation, the details of
which I was unable to understand, and was therefore
unable to remember fully. I said: “But it is intended
to drop the State subsidy, through which you hoped to
reconcile the labouring classes, by getting them to recognise
that the State not only makes demands upon them,
but also comes to their assistance, procuring relief for
them in case of need, and providing for their future as
far as possible.”</p>

<p>“No, not dropped,” he replied, “but it is not immediately
necessary in the new form which the Bill has
taken. In about five or ten years it will be seen how
far the contributions go, and in fifteen years’ time it
may be asked whether, and to what extent, the State
should contribute. It is sufficient for the present that
all sums falling due are immediately paid, the State
guaranteeing the amount.”</p>

<p>He again explained this in detail, and then said:
“I am tired and ill, and should prefer to go, once I got
my release from the Reichstag, but I do not like to
leave the old Emperor alone. When he lay on his back
after the outrage, I vowed to myself that I would not.
Otherwise, I would rather be in the country at Friedrichsruh.
I always felt better there; while here I get
excited and angry, and become so weak that I can
scarcely work for a couple of hours without losing hold
of my ideas. How beautiful and fresh it was there
in the country. I enjoyed every day, driving out and
seeing how fine the rye looked, and how healthy the
potatoes!”</p>

<p>This led him on to speak of the hope which he had
of a good harvest, and that again to the price of corn
in Germany and England. In this connection he observed,
<i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>: “The opinion that low prices for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>
corn mean happiness, welfare and content is a superstition.
In that case the inhabitants of Lithuania and
Rumania ought to be the most prosperous of all, while
prosperity should decrease in proportion as you come
west towards Aix la Chapelle. In England, the price
of corn is now lower than here, and yet discontent prevails
among the poorer classes, Radicalism is spreading,
a revolution is approaching, and that democratic
republic for which Gladstone and his friends and associates,
Chamberlain and Dilke, have helped to pave the
way, will come. It is just the same in Spain and Italy,
where the dynasties, it is true, will offer resistance, but
probably to no purpose. In France it remains to be
seen whether the Republic will maintain itself, and if
it does a condition of things will arise similar to that in
America, where respectable people consider it disgraceful
to have anything to do with practical politics, or to
become a Senator, Congress man, or Minister.”</p>

<p>On my rising he walked about the room for a while,
continuing to speak, but sat down again soon as if he
felt tired. He mentioned Herbert, who is still in
London, and from this I turned the conversation on to
Hatzfeldt, remarking that his appointment as Secretary
of State had not yet taken place. He rejoined: “That
is due solely to the fact that he himself has not yet
declared in favour of remaining. He has still to complete
his arrangements, and settle with his brother about
a mortgage. Moreover, I cannot blame him if he prefers
to draw&mdash;(I did not catch the amount) in Constantinople,
where things are cheaper, than 15,000 thalers
here. He has a fortune of about 100,000 thalers. I
wanted more for him, 60,000 marks, but the Federal
Council rejected the proposal, as they could not give
the Secretary of State more than the Imperial Chancellor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>
who receives only 54,000, but who has become
wealthy thanks to public grants. You cannot expect
everybody to be prepared to make sacrifices. Every
one is not disposed to lead a simple life, cutting his
coat according to his cloth, and to forego great entertainments
and other expensive habits; and then it is a
case of five into four won’t go, so I borrow one. He
must, however, decide between this and July. Otherwise
we shall have to ask Dr. Busch.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” I replied. He said: “There are
two doctors of that name, and I mean the other, not
Büschlein. But Busch has as poor health as Hatzfeldt,
who is effeminate to boot, wraps himself up like a
Frenchman, and goes to bed when he has a headache
or cold, so that I have already been obliged to do their
work instead of their taking over mine.”</p>

<p>From these invalids he passed on to the Empress.
“She lives on and is again in good health, but a great
deal of my illness comes from her intrigues. Schleinitz
is also on his legs again, although he was very ill.
Doubtless he thinks: ‘Perhaps there may be some more
Jewish <i lang="fr" title="gratuities">pourboires</i>, so I must keep alive!’”</p>

<p>I asked if he would speak in the debate in the
Reichstag on the monopoly. “Yes,” he said, “if my
health permits it. Not for the purpose of convincing
them, but to bear witness before the country, and then
to demand my release.” I inquired whether he intended
to go to Kissingen again this summer. “No,” he replied.
“Although the waters have usually been very beneficial,
they did me no good the last time. For nearly four
months afterwards I was tormented with hæmorrhoids
that were fearfully painful, burning like hell fire.” He
then added a description of the symptoms.</p>

<p>Before leaving I also asked: “How do you like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span>
Chevalier Poschinger,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Serene Highness? There is a
great deal of interesting matter in the collection, but
it seems to me that he might have made a better choice.
But I suppose all the documents did not come into his
hands?” He replied: “That, too, had something to
do with it. But there is a great deal that has not got
into the archives, such as my letters to the late King,
which were retained by Gerlach and which his heirs
will not easily part with. But even as it is, the book is
very instructive, as it contains a great deal which was
not known so accurately before; and it is perhaps well
that those letters and other things should remain unpublished
for the present.”</p>

<p>He had in the meantime shaken hands several times
by way of taking leave of me, but each time started
some new subject which caused me to remain. He now
reached me his hand for the last time, and thanking
him for giving me the pleasure of seeing him after such
a long interval I took my leave. As usual after such
interviews, I went straight home in order to write down
what I had heard without delay, before anything else
should chance to blur the impression.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July I again visited Bucher. He
complained once more of the indifferent way in which
business was done at the Foreign Office and in the
Imperial Chancellerie. Herbert sent his father, Holstein
or Rantzau private reports of what he picked up in
London society, the clubs, &amp;c.&mdash;mostly gossip&mdash;which
was then forwarded to the Emperor and occasionally
made use of in the press. The correct thing for him to
do would be to communicate what he had heard to his
Chief, the Ambassador, who could then forward it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
separately, or include it in his own despatches. Herbert
reported recently that after the murder of Cavendish
and Burke, Gladstone, when sitting in his place in
Parliament, covered his face with his hands in order to
show the depth of his affliction, although the event was
in every way opportune for him. That evening, however,
he was.... Rantzau then came to him,
Bucher, to say that the Chief would like to see that
mentioned in one of the papers, but not in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>, and to ask whether he,
Bucher, would see to it. Bucher replied that his instructions
were to write only for the <cite>Post</cite> and the
<cite lang="de">Norddeutsche</cite>. He would, however, prepare it for the
press and Rantzau could then give it to Lindau, who
might get it into the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>, or into one of
the Hamburg papers. After a while Rantzau returned
and said that in Lindau’s opinion one of the phrases
would be better if translated into the <i lang="la" title="indirect speech">oratio obliqua</i>.
“But,” said Bucher, smiling, “it was a quotation, yet
neither of them recognised it, although it was taken
from Schiller. I said to him they could do what they
liked with it, and since then they have not pestered me
with such matters.” Bucher confirmed what the
Chancellor had told me respecting Prince William’s
attitude and way of thinking in political matters. He
added that the Prince had told some of his acquaintances
how much he disapproved of his mother reading
the <cite lang="de">Volkszeitung</cite>, and identifying herself with the views
of the Progressist party. Bucher then mentioned that
a member of the Crown Prince’s <i lang="fr">entourage</i> had informed
him that one of the leaders of the National Liberals had
recently stated that they were not so very much opposed
to the tobacco monopoly, but wished to “keep their
consent to it as a gift for the next emperor.” He added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>
“I was about to write that to the Chancellor, whom I
now rarely see; but I saw from his speech on the
monopoly that he had already been informed of it.” In
Bucher’s opinion the most important feature in the
Egyptian question is “that we may expect it to lead to
a breach between France and England.... Our relations
with Austria are excellent. What he was not
able to tell you at the time is a fact. We have a formal
alliance with the Austrians, and the Chief has also done
something more, so that we are quite safe from war for
several years to come.”</p>

<p>With regard to Hatzfeldt, Bucher said: “He wants
to have the Secretaryship of State offered to him so that
he may make his acceptance conditional upon exorbitant
terms for himself. But the Chief, in order to avoid
placing himself under any obligations, means to leave it
to the Emperor to settle matters with him.”</p>

<p>We finally spoke about Eckart, whom it was intended
at first to employ in the Literary Bureau, but
who has now a prospect of an appointment in the
Ministry of the Interior. Bucher thinks the affair is a
demonstration of the Chief’s against the Russians, who
“always fancied until now that we must run to answer
the bell whenever they ring.” Eckart, by the way, no
longer makes the extracts from the newspapers for the
Foreign Office....</p>

<p>On the 19th of July, Bucher sent me an article from
the <cite lang="de">Deutsches Tageblatt</cite> of the 16th of July, entitled
“Hirsch-Bleichröder-Rothschild and Germany in Constantinople.”
It disclosed the financial intrigues of this
group of bankers, “choice members of the Chosen
People,” who exploit Turkey under the pretence that
they are protected by the German Government in the
persons of its representatives. It energetically protests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>
against this trio, and particularly against “Bleichröder,
who knows how to take advantage of the credit which
Germany enjoys at the Golden Horn in association with
persons who only manifest their national sentiments
and their patriotism when these can be turned to account
for their own transactions.” Bucher wrote: “I send
you this article for your Memorabilia. It will be
frequently mentioned hereafter. <i lang="de">Justizrath</i> Primker
of Berlin, is the agent of Bleichröder here referred
to.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August I received a card from Bucher,
in which he said: “I have to-day taken leave of
absence, and at the same time tendered my resignation.
I will tell you why at some future time. Auf
Wiedersehen.”</p>

<p>I therefore called upon him (Bucher) on the 2nd of
October, and at once inquired whether he decided to
retire or to remain on. He replied that he would
remain for the present. On the 1st of August he begged
the Chief to obtain the Emperor’s consent to his retirement.
In this letter the only motive which he gave was
consideration for his health (growing nervousness),
although, as I knew, he had other and stronger reasons.
He then proceeded to Bormio, whither the Prince’s
answer followed him. The Chief wrote that before
regarding his request as final, he would like Bucher to
come to Varzin to talk over the matter&mdash;he would
doubtless also be pleased to see the place once more.
He (Bucher) arranged to go there on his return from his
holiday, and accordingly proceeded to Varzin on Tuesday
last. There the Chancellor explained to him that he
still required the services of his knowledge and ability,
and although he could quite conceive that he was ailing
and tired, he believed he could get over that difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>
by giving him as much holiday as he liked at all times,
summer and winter. In future, also, he should be immediately
under him. To this Bucher replied that he did
not wish to retire altogether, but he had had a mind to
take up some work of importance which he could have
done at home in connection with documents in the
Archives that had not yet been used. He believed he
could do that work as well as the officials of the
Archives (Poschinger and Sybel). That might also be
done, the Chief said, but he must remain in the service;
he was indispensable to him. Bucher then begged to be
allowed two days to think the matter over, after the
lapse of which time he acceded to the Prince’s wishes.
He does not expect any good to come of the arrangement,
however, as in his opinion there will be no change
in the condition of affairs.</p>

<p>I then inquired how the Chief was getting on.
Bucher replied: “Not very well. He suffers from faceache,
which occurs constantly and is often very bad, but
passes away again after a while. The doctor thinks it
comes from a bad tooth, and has advised him to have it
out or let the nerve be killed. But the Chief will not
agree to this, as he does not believe in the doctor’s
opinion. When this is not tormenting him he is still
the same old amiable <i lang="fr" title="conversationalist">causeur</i>, and he often has
moments of inspiration too, when he speaks on political
affairs with astounding far-sightedness. I shall hardly
enjoy much more of it, however. During recent years
I have seen him more seldom than yourself, sometimes
not for two months at a time. But perhaps that may
improve again later or indeed very soon. A few days
ago when I was speaking to Rantzau about my resignation,
he said that was surely not necessary. It was
true that the Emperor might live to a great age, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span>
would probably not govern much longer and then it
would be the turn of the Crown Prince, who had not
altered since the conflict he had had with his father
twenty years ago. (Freytag’s account of this conflict
was handed over by me for publication to the <cite lang="de">Süddeutsche
Zeitung</cite> in Frankfurt-on-the-Main somewhere
about the summer of 1862. It made a great sensation at
the time and caused no little anxiety.) He was a regular
Progressist and already he made no secret of it.” While
I was away he had accepted Ludwig Löwe’s invitation
to inspect his revolver manufactory, and even deigned
to take breakfast there. Recently, on entering a
Court gathering at which Puttkamer and also three
Progressists, including Mommsen and Virchow, were
present he passed the Minister by and joined the
Liberal trio, with whom he then conversed in a demonstrative
fashion. It must be remembered that this took
place at a time when an action was being brought against
Mommsen for insulting the Chancellor. The Chief
was quite aware of this and speaking of the future
Emperor, he had said: “He will wish to retain me, but I
shall lay down my conditions, which he will agree to, but
he will not keep his promise.” Bucher continued as
follows: “Then the Chief will resign and proceed to
Varzin, which he even now does not wish to leave, and
a sort of colony will be founded there in connection with
which they doubtless have me also in view. It is then
intended to write memoirs. Speaking to me about them
in 1877, he said: ‘I have still a great deal to say to the
world.’&mdash;The Progressists are aware of the Crown
Prince’s views and they will then want to form a
Ministry taken from their own ranks. Virchow has
hinted as much in public speeches, adding that the
entire policy of the country including foreign affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span>
would be different.&mdash;Bismarck was a gifted politician
who represented a system of diplomacy which, except by
himself, had long since been regarded as played out.
That would lead to a pretty state of affairs, but would
not last long. In the meantime, however, many
blunders and an immense deal of harm might be
done.”</p>

<p>I then asked what he thought of Bismarck’s religious
sentiments, giving him my reasons for thinking that his
wife had influenced him in this respect. He agreed with
me and said that the views of the Moravian Brethren
prevailed in her family. For the rest it was very difficult
to form an opinion on those matters. He then
observed that Bismarck also believed in ghosts. There is
a castle in East Prussia which no one will inhabit as it
is said to be haunted by the ghost of a lady who
committed some crime. She is visible in broad daylight.
On one occasion, when this story was told in Bismarck’s
presence and some of the company spoke of it as folly,
the Chief said there might very well be something in it,
and that one ought not to laugh and jeer at such things,
as he himself had had a similar experience.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Bucher also considers such things possible. He said:
“A very remarkable incident of that kind once occurred
to myself. When I lived on the Lutzow Embankment&mdash;it
was during the first years of my appointment when I
had a great deal to do and was so tired in the evening
that I used to fall asleep as soon as I lay down&mdash;one
night I saw my mother stoop down over my bed and
smile contentedly, as if she were pleased that I had now
begun a regular life. I am quite certain that it was not
a dream.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span></p>

<p>Finally I told him I intended to leave Berlin and
return to Leipzig, as I had too little opportunity of
seeing and being of use to the Chief, and found little
society for my wife and myself. I would remain until
February, in order to take leave of the Prince in person,
and then proposed to come to Berlin a couple of times
every year to visit him. In the meantime, I would now
and then take the liberty of requesting him (Bucher) to
furnish me with advice, explanations and materials in
political affairs, while, on the other hand, I also should
be at his disposal, as before 1878, whenever he wished to
secure the insertion of anything in the press. Should
the Chancellor retire at any time I would write him
immediately, that he might count upon my services.
Bucher approved of these suggestions.</p>

<p>On the 2nd and 3rd of November Bucher sent me a
number of newspaper extracts referring to Bleichröder
and his relations with Hatzfeldt, and Augusta’s intrigues
against Bismarck, with which the latter in a
pencil note had associated the Jesuit, Father Beckx.
Bucher intends to write me further on the subject.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th of November I called on
Bucher at his lodgings, and reminded him of this promise.
He gave me the following information. “Hatzfeldt
intends to become Vice-Chancellor. For that
reason he has had himself made Minister of State, a
measure which was unwelcome to the Chief, and which
was managed with difficulty owing to the opposition of
his colleagues. Hatzfeldt has had that represented in
the press as necessary, supporting the contention by
precedent. Hohenlohe was once Vice-Chancellor. I
will cut out some of the newspaper articles and send
them to you. He had a <i lang="fr" title="denial">démenti</i> of the article on the
Hatzfeldt-Schapira affair (reproduced by the <cite lang="de">Volkszeitung</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span>
from the <cite lang="de">Süddeutsche Post</cite>) published in the
<cite lang="de">Deutsches Tageblatt</cite>, which the Chief reads. This article
was written by Viereck, a Social Democrat, while the
<i lang="fr" title="denial">démenti</i> was probably by Holstein or Fuchs. Hatzfeldt
is gradually disclosing his Catholic sympathies, using
his influence, for example, with the Minister of Public
Worship for the appointment of certain Catholic clergymen.
Bleichröder, senior, applied to the Parisian
Rothschild and the <i lang="de">Discontogesellschaft</i> to co-operate
in his great Turkish railway and tobacco monopoly
scheme, as his own funds were not sufficient; without
success, however, as the latter did not wish to have any
dealings with such a corpse as Turkey. He had also
been to Busch, the Under-Secretary of State, and had
hoped to obtain his support for the scheme, as in
the Rumanian affair, which was a disgrace to us. The
support was given in that case owing to the pressing
appeals of the old Hohenzollern, Prince Charles’
father.”</p>

<p>On one occasion in the sixties Corvin (Wiersbycki)<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
had at Bucher’s instance written in an English newspaper
against the Empress Augusta. The Chief had instructed
Bucher to get this done, as such attacks influenced the
Court, which was afraid of the press. Corvin then
borrowed a hundred thalers from Bucher, and only paid
him back twenty-five. “He probably forgot the remainder.
But the article was very well done.” Finally
Bucher mentioned that Lindau was now ill. The
Prince’s son had formerly begged in writing not to
let it be noticed that Lindau was incapable, and he had
retained the letter. “Heyking has now for a considerable
time past been looking after the press; but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
while you and I managed that alone, he has taken on
a Count Henckel as an assistant. The latter, who reads
the newspapers for him, has again appointed one of
the men in the office to act as amanuensis, and do ‘the
scissors and paste.’ They are fond of their ease, these
aristocratic gentlemen!”</p>

<p class="firstpara">On the morning of Monday, the 27th of November,
1882, I called upon Bucher to hand him a packet with
two articles and a letter to be forwarded to the Prince at
Varzin, which he promised to do. The latter ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Hochverehrter Herr Reichskanzler</span>,<br>
</p>

<p class="extra">“Every man has his own ambition. Mine
consists in studying and giving as true as possible a
picture of your Serene Highness. I am accordingly
about to write a new book respecting you in which the
more important material scattered through my previous
book will be brought together and supplemented from
my own observation, and such sources as the letters
in Hesekiel’s work, and the despatches published by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span>
Poschinger and in Hahn’s collection. It will not be
a biography, but only a detailed character sketch, in a
number of chapters, such as Bismarck and Parliamentarism,
Bismarck and the German Question, Bismarck
and Religion, the Legend of Junker Bismarck, Bismarck
and the Diplomatists, Bismarck and the Social Problem,
Bismarck as Public Speaker and Humorist, Bismarck
and Austria, France, Russia and the Poles, and, finally,
Bismarck in Private Life. The way in which I propose
to treat the subject will appear from the two articles
herewith enclosed, which I would beg you to regard as
mere preliminary studies. The first of these, ‘Bismarck
as a Junker,’ being a harmless sketch, has already been
published in the monthly periodical, <cite lang="de">Aus Allen Zeiten
und Landen</cite>, and the second, ‘Bismarck and Religion,’
is to appear in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>. In case of new material
coming into my possession both shall be re-written for
the book, the object of which is to assist the future
historian, and at the same time to be useful to yourself.
Everything calculated to interfere with the latter
purpose shall be omitted. It is highly desirable that I
should receive your Serene Highness’s help in the course
of the work. I therefore venture most respectfully to
recall the fact that Hesekiel was greatly assisted in this
way, and that your Serene Highness in 1873 held out
hopes to me of similar assistance. Moreover, as many
parts of the book will certainly produce the impression
that the author is well informed, it is to be feared that
should it at the same time contain errors, the public
may also accept them as true.</p>

<p>“I therefore beg in the first place that the two
specimen articles may be kindly revised and returned
to me, supplemented with as much new material as
possible, and, where needful, corrected. I would afterwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>
with your permission, send in from time to time
legibly written copies of other chapters, and crave the
same consideration for them.</p>

<p>“It may be said that such books should not be
written during the lifetime of the person described. I
take the liberty of rejoining that they can be best done
at that time, if confidence is reposed in the writer, as
he can then obtain fuller information than can be found
in archives, the contents of which are not always, later
on, rightly understood by every one.</p>

<p>“Should your Serene Highness desire to communicate
verbally with me on the matter, I am ready at all
times to obey your commands without delay.</p>

<p>“Your Serene Highness’s most respectful and devoted</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>At 11.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 1st of December, Bucher
called upon me to return the two articles that had been
sent to Varzin, namely, “Bismarck as a Junker” and
“Bismarck and Religion.” He at the same time communicated
to me the contents of a letter from Count
Herbert, to the effect that the Prince had read the
articles through, and had said with regard to the second
that he could communicate nothing on a matter of so
personal a character; and that he could not remember
having made the statement on page 2 that he had
“brought about three great wars.” It might be possible
to insert the word “perhaps” in that sentence. His
(Herbert’s) personal opinion was that nothing more
ought to be written about his father, and if he had any
influence with me he would use it in this direction. I
explained to Bucher that if the Prince himself had asked
me not to publish anything more about him, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>
most <em>probably</em> forbear to do so, but that Herbert had
no claim to any influence upon me. “What is Hecuba
to me?” I concluded.</p>

<p><i>December 19th.</i>&mdash;Received the following letter from
Bucher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A horrible cough has deprived me of my night’s
rest for the past fortnight, but I am a little better since
yesterday. As you do not read many of the newspapers,
I send you two extracts which will furnish material for
the history of the morals of our time.</p>

<p>“1. <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>, of the 15th
instant.&mdash;The following in print:&mdash;‘<i lang="de">Herr Justizrath</i>
Primker is returning to Constantinople in order to join
the Council for the administration of the Turkish State
Debt in connection with the establishment of the
tobacco monopoly and the unification of the Debt. The
reports received from various correspondents respecting
that gentleman’s failure or success in connection with
any other financial mission are all erroneous. How far
the investigations made by <i lang="de">Herr Justizrath</i> Primker
respecting matters of commerce and means of communication
in the East may be utilised in the interest of
German capital remains a question for the future.’”
Bucher then goes on to say: “Unquestionably prepared
by Bleichröder, and intended to serve as a kind of
official credentials for his agent. You are sufficiently
acquainted with the position of that newspaper to know
that such an article would not have been accepted unless
some one in the Foreign Office (Hatzfeldt) had had the
matter in hand.</p>

<p>“2. <cite lang="de">Deutsches Tageblatt</cite> of the 19th instant.&mdash;The
following also in print:&mdash;‘We are pleased to learn from
an incidental paragraph in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung</cite> that <i lang="de">Justizrath</i> Primker, one of Messrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span>
Bleichröder’s agents for international transactions, has
had and has no other financial mission in Constantinople
than to represent their firm. We are glad to see this
statement in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>,
because&mdash;as one of our well-informed Vienna correspondents
has shown&mdash;<i lang="de">Justizrath</i> Primker has contrived in
Constantinople to make it appear as if he were on the
staff of the German Embassy, and as if the German
Government were backing him up with all its influence
and approval, a circumstance which we should deeply
regret, as Primker’s efforts are directed to promoting the
interests of Bleichröder and of the notorious Baron
Hirsch, and do not tend to the furtherance of the general
interests of the German Empire on the Bosphorus.
Herr Primker is again going to Constantinople, ostensibly
to take part in the work of the Council of the Turkish
Public Debt in introducing the tobacco monopoly
administration and unifying the State Debt. The
Council, as is well known, has charge of the interests of
the European creditors of Turkey, and with this object
supervises the administration of the Turkish Public Debt.
It protects, however, only the interests of the larger
creditors, as is shown by the attitude adopted by Herr
Primker, who knew how to secure all the advantages for
Herr Bleichröder and his partners, while entirely
neglecting the claims of the poorer holders of Turkish
securities in Germany, so that they actually came off
worst of all in the arrangements ultimately made. And
yet it was these who ought to have been considered in
the very first place, as the net receipts of the Turkish
railways amounted to about four million francs, a sum
which was sufficient to provide for a fair interest on the
securities. It is well known, however, that Baron Hirsch
is still able to withhold these receipts from the Turkish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>
Administration, and is assisted in doing so by his
business friend, Herr Bleichröder, who is quite indifferent
as to whether the interests of others and particularly
of German creditors suffer thereby. One hawk does not
peck out another hawk’s eyes. Even if we can do
nothing to remedy this state of affairs, we can at least
help people to recognise the bird by its feathers.’
(Bucher’s letter now follows once more.) I am sufficiently
acquainted with the management of this paper to know
that such an article must at least have been sanctioned
in a higher quarter (Bismarck).”</p>
</div>

<p><i>December 20th.</i>&mdash;The day before yesterday I wrote
to the Imperial Chancellor begging for an interview, and
in case there were anything to mention in the press to
supply me with the necessary information. At 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
to-day a Chancery attendant brought me a letter from
<i lang="de">Hofrath</i> Sachse, marked “Urgent,” in which Bismarck
“requested me to be good enough to visit him this
afternoon at 4 o’clock.” I went to the palace at the
time appointed. Theiss showed me in to the Prince,
with whom I remained for three-quarters of an hour.
He had a white beard, and was sitting at his writing-table.
After reaching me his hand he said: “You have
doubtless come with great expectations, and think I shall
have something to say to you about the article in the
<cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>&mdash;the one on Russian armaments.”
I asked: “Did that come from here?”</p>

<p>He: “No, not from me; but from the military
authorities.”</p>

<p>I: “And the statements are correct?”</p>

<p>He: “Certainly. They are constructing many more
railways than they require for trade and traffic, and
the garrisons in the western towns and fortresses have
been placed almost upon a war footing. I should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>
be surprised if there were a war with them next year.
The Bourse has also shown itself much concerned, but
I believe that the fall in quotations arises rather from
anxiety respecting France. But (he continued) you
have been indiscreet in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> in your reference
to the alliance with Austria. It has been very awkward
for them (in Austria), for the Hungarian Diet can now
come and demand information on the subject.”</p>

<p>I replied: “I thought that the matter had gradually
leaked out. Three or four months ago some one, I forget
now who it was, said to me that everybody now knew that
a formal alliance existed, and not a mere memorandum.
Perhaps my informant had it from Vienna. I was
therefore of opinion that it could do no harm, and might
possibly be of use if I mentioned it incidentally, as I did
in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article, and I was quite astounded
when all the newspapers wrote leading articles upon it.
I must be very much mistaken if I have not seen something
similar elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “but it was a State secret, and if
you had only remembered from whom you had it, an
inquiry might well be instituted. It is quite possible
that something of the kind had already been said elsewhere;
and if what you wrote had appeared in another
paper, perhaps no one would have taken any notice of
it. But you have given the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> such a nimbus
that it is placed on a level with the Official Gazette.
That is not good for you as a writer. You are regarded
as, in the highest degree, inspired.”</p>

<p>I: “That is a matter of indifference to me. It only
excites hatred and envy; and I have never associated
with the local journalists.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, smiling, “you can destroy this nimbus
if you will only write something thoroughly silly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span></p>

<p>I: “And if you then have a vigorous <i lang="fr" title="denial">démenti</i>
inflicted upon me.”</p>

<p>He: “But, seriously, you can to a certain extent
correct the statement which you blurted out inadvertently,
by saying that in doing so you believed you were
only repeating what was already known; and you might
go on to add a number of useful observations, as, for
instance, that, if the alliance did not actually exist,
it ought to be brought about, as it would be of great
advantage and would fulfil the requirements of two
peace-loving Powers&mdash;and, further, that we should very
much regret the truth of the assertion made by the
<cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite> that it had only been concluded for
five years; in that case it should be extended over a
longer period. Finally, it would be in accordance with
the interests of both Empires to strengthen and consolidate
the good political relations existing between them
by closer commercial relations on a treaty basis.”</p>

<p>He then returned to the question of the Russian
armaments, and said, <i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>: “Now I am to assist!
But they can settle the matter themselves. Three years
ago I made proposals to them which they would not
accept. Now let <em>them</em> settle it!”</p>

<p>He reflected for a while, and then suddenly exclaimed:
“Can you find us money, and rid us of the bailiff?...
Parliament will not agree to the licensing tax, not even
the Conservatives, each one of whom is cleverer than
the other, while they are all of them wiser than the
Government. Here there is nothing but discord, and
the majority are blockheads. What is the use of their
Conservatism when they will not support us? A
progressive income tax is unjust, and would not be of
much assistance, but an equitable income tax would be
good and useful. That can be obtained by self-assessment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>
and it would in a short time cover the deficit in
the four classes. The higher classes&mdash;14,000&mdash;pay about
seven million marks, and to double that amount would
be oppressive, it would mean a tax of 26 per cent. The
capitalist is either a mortgagee, and if his taxes are raised,
he turns upon his debtor and raises his interest to 5 or
5½ per cent. interest, instead of 4; or a loan and debenture
company, and then its securities would lose as much
in value as the tax amounts to; or a holder of industrial
shares, and then the tax might reduce or indeed destroy
the export trade in the manufactured article. The State
cannot tax its own securities, and therefore there only
remain foreign securities and railway shares. People are
not afraid of the capitalist, but only of the tobacconist,
the wine merchant, and the brewer. Of the capitalist
one may say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="de">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“‘I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For though I am not splenetive and rash,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet have I in me something dangerous,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which let thy wisdom fear!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“If the Conservatives were at one with the Government
all would be well. As it is, however, we shall doubtless
be obliged to dissolve again in February, and then there
will not be so many Conservatives returned. The King
has so far committed himself that he can no longer
govern with the bailiff. His position is most painful, and
he will ultimately ask the country again and again
whether the bailiff is to be retained.”</p>

<p>He then spoke about Wedell-Malchoff’s motion for
taxing time bargains on the Bourse. In his opinion it
was not a bad idea, but the phrase “time bargains”
should be defined, and in such a way as not to include
genuine transactions in rye and spirits or cash transactions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>
Furthermore, it should start, not with two per
mille, but, as the Government had proposed, with one
per mille. The latter would be feasible, and of course
once a beginning had been made it could be raised. The
mistake here was that they were trying to get at dishonest
transactions, and thus to introduce a moral tax,
whilst such transactions could not possibly be defined or
reached. The Chancellor’s statements were somewhat to
the foregoing effect. More I cannot say, as I did not
understand all these financial explanations, in which he
doubtless credited me with more technical knowledge and
capacity than I possess to supplement their purport.</p>

<p>In the course of his remarks he mentioned Bleichröder’s
name, and I asked whether he had noticed
certain hints that Bleichröder’s schemes with regard to
the Turkish tobacco monopoly and railways were being
promoted by German diplomacy. He denied the fact.
It was true, indeed, that in the Rumanian affair Bleichröder
had been supported, because, in that instance, in
addition to some distinguished gentlemen, a great
number of small investors were concerned. Of the
former he mentioned Ujest, and, if I am not mistaken,
Lehndorff. There Bleichröder had really done good
service, “gallantly risking his money, and it was for
that reason that he had been ennobled by the King.”
Primker, on the other hand, he described as “clever
but unscrupulous.” As to the Austrian Government, he
observed that they had committed themselves too far
with Hirsch.</p>

<p>We finally came to speak about his neuralgia, which
caused him a great deal of pain. I suggested that it
probably came from a bad tooth.</p>

<p>He: “Others have thought the same, but the doctor
has hammered at all my teeth, and says they are sound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>
No, it is a nervous affection, muscular pain, particularly
when I am worried and excited. That is why I
do not attend the Parliamentary sittings; for what a
delight it would be to certain people if, in the middle of
a speech, I suddenly made a wry face, and were unable
to proceed!” He dismissed me with the words:
“Adieu, Büschlein, auf Wiedersehen! But take care
to avoid further indiscretions.”</p>

<p><i>January 14th, 1883.</i>&mdash;Called this morning on
Bucher to give him my new address.</p>

<p>Bucher then expressed a hope that the Bleichröder
swindle, which was becoming more and more widely
known, would ultimately be mentioned in the Reichstag.
I told him that, in speaking to the Chief recently, I
had referred to certain newspaper articles on the subjects,
and that he declared he knew nothing of diplomatic
influence having been exercised in that way at
Constantinople, and had, moreover, praised Bleichröder’s
action in the Rumanian affair. Bucher exclaimed
angrily: “Well then, he lied to you in that matter....
It is true, indeed, that Bleichröder and the
Disconto Bank plunged into the affair gallantly, but it
was not for the sake of the poor tailors, cobblers and
cooks that had blundered into it, but because the
Prince of Hohenzollern was also involved.”</p>

<p>Bucher also denounced as “a lie” the Prince’s statement
that the article in the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite> which
followed the paragraph in <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> on the Austro-German
Alliance, and emphasised, first its five years’
duration, and then the warlike preparations of the
Russians, did not come from the Foreign Office, but from
the military authorities. (Perhaps this assertion was
intended to lead me into some “blunder” which would
have deprived the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> of its “nimbus.”)...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span>
“The article is by Kruse, who as you are aware is here.
I know also who corrected it.” (Probably Bismarck, or
possibly Bucher himself under his instructions.) The
fact that the Chief told me to advocate the renewal or
prolongation of the treaty, with additional commercial
provisions, (this was done subsequently in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
and was noted and emphasised by the <cite>Post</cite>) tallies
according to Bucher with a proposal which the Chancellor
made in Vienna. He was, however, informed in
reply that that would not do, as Austria-Hungary
consisted of an industrial and an agricultural country,
with different interests. Bucher condemned the proposal,
saying: “He is in too great a hurry, because
he thinks he has only a few more years to live.” I
shall now take care to get away from Berlin as soon as
I can, and thus avoid further risk of hearing and circulating
untruths from the Chief’s mouth.</p>

<p><i>January 28th.</i>&mdash;Wrote to the Chief yesterday,
informing him that the editor of <cite>Harper’s Monthly</cite>
(published in London) had asked me to write an article
upon him, and if possible, also to send a photograph of
the Prince with his new full beard. At the same time I
added a request for an interview. On the same evening
I received an answer from the Imperial Chancellerie that
the Prince begged me to do him the honour of calling
upon him to-morrow, Sunday, at two o’clock. I went
accordingly to-day, and had to wait for a while, as the
Minister of Justice was with the Chancellor, and
Hatzfeldt was already waiting in the antechamber with
Möller, the Under-Secretary of State. When Hatzfeldt
was called in Möller dropped into conversation with me,
and asked me whether I was the author of <cite>Count
Bismarck and his People</cite>. He then turned out to be
an admirer of my former books also. He had read,
among others, the <cite>Pilgrimage to Jerusalem</cite> and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span>
the <cite>Wanderings between the Hudson and the Mississippi</cite>.
When Hatzfeldt came out, the attendant
immediately called me in. The Chief, who gave me a
very friendly reception, had a particularly bright colour
in the face. He asked: “Now then, what is it you
want me to tell you for the article? All the principal
facts are known.” I replied that I had come less on that
account than for the photograph. They had written to
me that thousands of Germans in America would be much
interested in seeing his portrait with the new beard.
“Yes,” he observed, “they now show their interest in
the old country by overloading me with contributions
for those who have suffered by the inundations on the
Rhine. I have not the least idea what I am to do
with them. I have talked over the matter with the
people in the Reichstag, they must distribute the money.
As to the photograph, however, the man suggested in
your letter (Brasch, in the Wilhelmstrasse) cannot do it,
as I have promised Löscher and Petsch, with whom I
have always been satisfied. But I cannot go to them at
present as I should catch cold in this weather, and also
because I do not go to the Emperor, and he would be surprised
if I were to be seen going to the photographer. But
I should myself like to see a portrait with the beard, as I
do not know how long I shall keep it.” I suggested that
he should let Brasch take two photographs only, as he
lived close by and would bring his camera here, one
of them being for <cite>Harper</cite> and one for me. He could
be forbidden to sell any copies. But the Chief considered
that that would be a breach of his word, and showed a
disposition to lose his temper, so I let the matter drop.</p>

<p>He spoke of the way in which they “hated him in
Parliament,” although “he had done them no harm.”
“I cannot understand it,” he continued. “It is not so
with other Ministers, even with those who have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span>
nothing but commit blunder after blunder, while I, at
least, have maintained peace for them. Surely the
present Ministry in France is a wretched concern,
English policy has been an unbroken series of blunders
for the last three years, and Gortschakoff, with his vanity,
also makes all sorts of mistakes; yet no one in their own
countries worries and hampers them in every direction.
Nor in other respects have I ever given them ground
for dissatisfaction. Other Ministers speculate on the
Stock Exchange, and take advantage of their office and
information to make money. It is asserted that several
French Ministers do so, and such cases also occur in
Austria, and particularly in Hungary, where the Zichys
have made millions in railway shares. Manteuffel and
Schleinitz took advantage of their position in the same
way. No one can say anything of the kind against me.
The Diest-Daber statements were slanders. I have
never held speculative securities, but only regular
dividend-bearing stock. It is only the national grants
that have given me my competency. I have made
nothing, but was, on the contrary, much better off
formerly than I am now, in consequence of the low
prices of corn and timber and unwise purchases of
land.... Nor have I led a loose life, but have, on the
contrary, been always a respectable father of a family.
And nothing of the kind can be said of my sons either.
(Really?) No charge can be brought against me, and
nevertheless I am hated. But I am tired. I have lost
my old passion for shooting and riding, and I fear I
shall soon lose my liking for politics. I am sacrificing
my health. I ought to live in the country, and the
doctors say that if I were free from business, and could
spend three or four hours a day in the open air, I should
be well again. But I do not like to desert the Emperor,
who will soon be eighty-seven, when he begs me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>
tears in his eyes to remain. Nor can I expect him to
accustom himself to others.”</p>

<p>I inquired how he now stood with the Crown Prince,
and he replied, “Latterly he has been very amiable to
me, particularly at the various festivities.” Then
returning, without any transition, to the subject of
Parliament and its opposition to himself, he said: “I
have maintained peace for them with a great deal of
trouble. After 1870 everybody expected war in a
couple of years; but so far it has not come, and perhaps,
indeed, it may never come again. We are now on a
better footing with Russia than we have ever been
before, and with Austria we have concluded an alliance.”
I asked him if he was still negotiating for an improvement
of the treaty in a commercial direction. He
rejoined: “I will not tell you that, as you have been
indiscreet enough to let it be known that it was only
concluded for a period of five years. The <cite lang="de">Kölnische
Zeitung</cite> has reproduced that from the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.”</p>

<p>I: “I beg your pardon, Serene Highness, but the
converse was the case. I could not have said it before
the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>, because I was not aware of the
fact until I read it in that paper.” He maintained his
opinion until I offered to prove to him that he was in
error, by sending him the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article. He then
went on to relate: “They (the Austrians) thought they
might satisfy their greed in that way. I imagine that
I am doing them a good turn and making them a
present, and then they come with their conditions. I
have rejected them. A commercial treaty is possible in
which we might grant them more favourable terms than
to the others, and in which the tariff would not be
raised, indeed perhaps reduced. The high duties which
we have imposed upon Russia and America need not be
applied to Austrian maize and barley. The importation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
of cattle may also be allowed, although that is scarcely
feasible in view of the certificates given in Galicia and
Hungary, where everything can be bought and everybody
can be bribed. But commercial union and a
common customs frontier are out of the question, for
Germany takes plenty of imported goods, and superior
foreign wines are consumed here in Germany, while even
a groschen would be too much for a Slovak or a Raizen
(<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, a Servian of Slavonia or Lower Hungary), who uses
nothing of the kind. Even here there is a great
difference between the Elbe Duchies or the Rhenish
provinces and East Prussia or Upper Silesia.”</p>

<p>He then came once more to speak of the peaceful
times in which we are now living, and said: “You have
only to look at the newspapers and see how empty they
are, and how they fish out the ancient sea-serpent in
order to have something to fill their columns. The
feuilleton is spreading more and more, and if anything
sensational occurs they rush at it furiously and write it
to death for whole weeks. This low water in political
affairs, this distress in the journalistic world, is the
highest testimonial for a Minister of Foreign Affairs.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence he went on: “Then you
propose to return to Leipzig?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “since the death of my son, my
wife requires amusement and society, which are not to
be had here, but which she may find in her own native
town.”</p>

<p>He: “Well, but surely any one who writes on
politics ought to live in Berlin, where politics are now
made.”</p>

<p>I: “But Leipzig is only three hours from here, and
during the months when you are in town I can easily
reside here.”</p>

<p>He: “That is not necessary, but you might come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>
every fortnight, or when anything occurs, and ask
me.”</p>

<p>He again complained of the neuralgic pains, at the
same time dipping his finger, as he had already done
frequently, in a wine glass containing some strong-smelling
yellow liquid, with which he rubbed his right
cheek bone. “That relieves me for a short time,” he
said. He then continued: “But I am very tired. I
have now been engaged in politics practically since 1847,
nearly forty years, and that is exhausting. At first in
Parliament, then at Frankfurt, where I was very busy,
having work thrown upon me from Berlin also.”</p>

<p>I: “That can be seen from Poschinger’s book, which
I am now reading and making extracts from.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, but he does not say that I also wrote
numerous letters to the King from Frankfurt,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and that
I came no less than thirteen times in one year to Berlin
to see him.”</p>

<p>I: “It looks almost as if already at Frankfurt you
had been his Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;at least
Manteuffel drew his inspiration from you in the principal
questions.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, the late King discussed all great questions
with me, and Manteuffel put up with it.”</p>

<p>I mentioned that the extracts which I was making
from the documents contained in Poschinger’s book were
intended in the main for the chapter on “Bismarck and
Austria,” in which I proposed to embody what I had
personally gathered in 1870, as, for instance, Prince
Luitpold’s abortive letter to the Emperor Francis
Joseph.</p>

<p>He: “Certainly! But as long ago as 1866 I made
an attempt to come to an understanding with them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>
I suppose I have already told you the Gablentz
story?”</p>

<p>I: “No, but you have told me others from that
period, as, for instance, how the King wanted to annex
portions of Saxony, Bavaria and Bohemia, and how you
persuaded him not to do so.”</p>

<p>He: “Well, it occurred in this way. Just after
the first shot had been fired (in reality it must have
been about a fortnight before) I sent Gablentz, the
brother of the general, to the Emperor at Vienna
with proposals for peace on a dualistic basis. I
instructed him to point out that we had seven or eight
hundred thousand men under arms, while they also had
a great number. It would therefore be better for us
both to come to an agreement, and making a change of
front towards the West, unite our forces in attacking
France, recapture Alsace, and turn Strassburg into a
federal fortress. The French were weak as compared
with us. There might be no just cause for war, but we
could plead with the other Powers that France had also
acted unjustly in taking Alsace and Strassburg, whence
she had continually menaced South Germany ever since.
If we were to bring these as a gift to the Germans they
would accept our dualism. They, the Austrians, should
rule in the South and have command of the seventh and
eighth army corps, while we should have command of
the ninth and tenth and the federal command in chief
in the North.... Dualism is a very ancient institution,
as old as the Ingævones and Istævones, Guelphs and
Ghibellines.”</p>

<p>I observed: “Already under the Othos, indeed as
long ago as Charlemagne with his Franks, and the
Saxons.” “High German and Low German,” I said.
“With a Celtic fringe below and a Slavonic fringe
above.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” he continued, “Gablentz submitted his
proposal to the Emperor, who seemed not disinclined
to entertain it, but declared he must first hear the views
of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mensdorff, you
know. He, however, was a weak-minded mediocrity,
unequal to ideas of that calibre, and he said he must
first take counsel with the Ministers. They were in
favour of war with us. The Minister of Finance said he
believed they would beat us&mdash;and he must first of all get
a war indemnity of five hundred millions out of us, or a
good opportunity for declaring the insolvency of the
State. The Minister of War was not displeased with my
suggestion, but in his opinion we ought to have our own
fight out first, and then we could come to an understanding
and fall upon the French together. So Gablentz returned
without having effected his purpose, and a day or two
afterwards the King and myself started for the seat of
war.”</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly for this important and
startling communication, and asked him if I might use
it in my book. He replied: “Yes, it is for that
purpose that I have related it to you. But not in
detail, merely the main features. Proposal for peace
on the dualistic basis, united attack upon France, and
the reconquest of Alsace.”</p>

<p>I then asked once more whether he wished to read
the book before it went to press, and he said: “Yes, in
order that you may not include anything false in my
epitaph.”</p>

<p>I: “That would certainly not be done intentionally.
You know that I worship you, and would let myself be
cut into a thousand pieces for you.”</p>

<p>He: “Ah, no; not into so many! It is not
necessary.”</p>

<p>I: “Well then, only into two pieces, so that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span>
might see half a Büschlein (little Busch) fall to the
right and half to the left!”</p>

<p>On my then begging him as soon as his health permitted
to let Löscher and Petsch come to take his
portrait, he promised to do so, adding: “If they do
not care to come, then the other man can&mdash;what’s his
name?”</p>

<p>I: “Brasch, here in the Wilhelmstrasse, at the
corner of the Leipzigerstrasse.”</p>

<p>He: “But I must first keep my word.”</p>

<p>I: “I did not ask you to do anything contrary to it.
I only thought of Brasch because he took a very good
photograph of my late son.”</p>

<p>He: “How did the thing happen?” I then related
shortly the circumstances of my son’s death.</p>

<p>He: “That is a sad case, and there are many to
share your misfortune, all who had relatives on board
the <i>Cimbria</i>.”</p>

<p>I: “But my son was engaged in his profession, in
the fulfilment of his duty, and died bravely and
conscientiously for his ship like a soldier for his flag.”</p>

<p>He reached me his hand, and said, “Auf Wiedersehen!”
I had been with him fully three-quarters of
an hour, and all this time good old Möller had to wait
in the antechamber.</p>

<p>On returning home on the evening of the 3rd of
February, I found lying on my table a letter from
Count Bill, in which, at his father’s request, he enclosed
a new photograph of the latter with a full white beard.</p>

<p>On the 24th of February I wrote to the Chancellor
begging to be allowed to take leave of him personally,
as I proposed to start for Leipzig on the following
Thursday. I handed the letter to the porter at the
palace at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and in about an hour and a half I
received an invitation through Sachse to call upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span>
Prince at 3 o’clock. He was in the room behind his
study, which opens on the garden. He was in an
armchair, half sitting, half lying, and had beside him
a small table covered with documents. After he had
asked me how I was, he complained that he still felt
very poorly. When one trouble left him another
set in. The neuralgic faceache often prevented him
from sleeping. If he could only go to the country,
away from business, things might improve; but the
King would not grant him leave, and “pestered him
with all sorts of unimportant orders,” &amp;c., as, for
instance, with the question as to who should go to
St. Petersburg to attend the coronation. “He thinks,”
he continued, “that if I can manage to keep on my
legs I shall live to be old,&mdash;and if not, why then I
must die in the fulfilment of my duty.... And here
in the Foreign Office I have no proper assistance. Look
at that pile of documents which I must read through
myself!” I said: “Of course there is not much to
be done with Hatzfeldt. He has little ability, and still
less inclination, to work. He only wants to amuse
himself, and to draw a big salary for doing so.” “Yes,”
he replied, “Hatzfeldt does little for his money, and
has neither a good memory nor a taste for business.”
He then continued: “The Crown Prince is also inconsiderate,
and torments me with matters of no
importance; and, in addition to that, the people in the
Diet are committing all sorts of blunders. How abusive
they have been during the past few days! But it is
the same everywhere with Parliaments and Ministers.”
I remarked: “Quite so, for instance in France.” “It
is no better in England,” he rejoined. “The European
is no longer making progress. There is nothing more to
be done with him.” He repeated that he was sick of
politics, and wanted quiet. He then spoke of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>
Kulturkampf, observing: “The Pope is really well
disposed, but he is not so powerful and independent as
one may think; he is dependent upon people who will
have no peace. For some time it appeared as if a
<i lang="la" title="interim agreement">modus vivendi</i> could be arrived at, but now that is at
an end. On the signs of approaching fine weather
Windthorst threatened to strike and resign the leadership
of the Centre party. He wants a stormy sky for
other purposes, for stirring up discontent and strife, and
they on the other hand need him, or think they do.
They accordingly became frightened in Rome, and now
they are once more making themselves unpleasant.”
I said: “Catholicism has always been a secondary consideration
for Windthorst. He is, above everything
else, the well-paid advocate of the Guelphs.”</p>

<p>He rejoined: “Ah, he believes in nothing whatever.
He has absolutely no religion.”</p>

<p>He caught sight of an envelope which I had brought
with me and laid on the table beside us containing an
enlargement by Brasch of his photograph by Löscher.
He asked: “What have you there?” I answered: “It
usually happens that granting one request brings on
another, and that is the case now. I have had your
last portrait enlarged and mounted, and I would now
beg your Serene Highness to write your name under it
as a souvenir. Of course it can be done in pencil.”
“No,” he said, “in ink.” He rang for the attendant
and asked for “a pen to write my signature,” and then
wrote under the photograph: “<abbr lang="de" title="von">v.</abbr> Bismarck, Berlin,
24 February, 1883.”</p>

<p>I thanked him and said: “It is then arranged,
Serene Highness, that I may come here and address
myself to you occasionally when anything of importance
arises, particularly when there would seem to be
anything on foot in which you might wish to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span>
some one near you in whom you could repose special
confidence? And as to the book, I may send you the
proofs in a few months? We shall probably not begin
printing before August.” He agreed to all this, and
then said: “Well, good-bye, Busch. Auf Wiedersehen!
Enjoy yourself in Leipzig <span lang="de">‘an der Pleisse.</span>’” He
pronounced these words with a true Saxon accent.</p>

<p>On the 13th of May I came from Leipzig to Berlin,
and reported myself to the Chancellor by letter....
On the 15th Sachse sent me word that the Chancellor
expected me at 3 o’clock. I presented myself punctually
at the time appointed, and had to wait while the Chancellor
had a short interview with Rottenburg.... The
latter referred to Colonel Vogt’s <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article on
Thibaudin, and mentioned that the Imperial Chancellor
had remarked that it was no business of ours to point
out to the French that their army was in bad hands.
Count Rantzau also came across to shake hands with
me. The Chief’s youngest grandchild, Heinrich, some
five months old, was also in the antechamber, and he
also gave me his little hand to shake.</p>

<p>I was then with the Prince from 3.5 to 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> He
was in plain clothes, and sat at his ordinary double
writing-table. He did not look ill, but complained as
usual of his neuralgia. He said: “It now extends
over the whole body, the chest and abdomen, and I can
no longer exert myself to think or work for any length
of time&mdash;two hours at the outside; then I must give up,
or drink champagne or something of that kind to keep
myself going for a while longer. I ought to get out of
harness altogether, but the Emperor will not consent to
this, and even when I go to the country, business and
worry now follow at my heels.” I asked: “Worry
with the gentlemen in Parliament?” “Ah, no,” he
replied; “I no longer read their speeches and brawling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span>
It is the Ministers. Scholz is all right, as also Bötticher
and Maybach, although the latter is somewhat blunt,&mdash;but
the others, and particularly those in the Foreign
Office!” I said: “But surely Bucher and Busch are
able and diligent.” “That is so,” he rejoined; “but
Bucher is cross-tempered and soured, and Busch is sinking
under his load of work. I was mistaken in Hatzfeldt.
He is very good for negotiating with the King and the
Crown Prince, but he thinks only of his own interest,
and would like to be my successor; but he has no sense
of duty and no love of work.” I added: “One
or at most two hours’ work in the day, as formerly&mdash;and
then to play a game of croquet or lawn tennis with Mrs.
or Madame So-and-so.” “Yes,” he said, “that’s his way.
Like Lucca. <i lang="de" title="Our little Paul is very lazy">Unser Paulchen ist sehr faulchen</i> (Our
little Paul is very lazy). His Excellency Herr von
Keudell also wanted to become Imperial Chancellor one
day, and absurd as the notion was, he worked it through
his friends in the press, who had to praise him up to the
skies and represent him as your intimate adviser. But
I always regarded him as quite insignificant in politics,
and in addition to that he could never do any work. He
found a difficulty in managing the most ordinary affairs.
I was often obliged to do things for him, and once at
Versailles Taglioni, the deciphering clerk, finished off no
less than thirty documents for him with which he was in
arrears. It is true that he was very clever in looking
after his own interests.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, and he also knew how to get himself a
rich wife, and to take advantage of the position which
he acquired through the friendship of my wife and his
own musical talent. Moreover, he knew how to impress
people with his importance&mdash;through his silence. But
there was nothing behind it. He is stupid, empty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span>
incapable. He was unable even to manage the Pay
Department properly.”</p>

<p>I: “On going to Constantinople it is said that he
left a deficit of 80,000 thalers.”</p>

<p>The Chief then spoke of Hohenlohe, and appeared
to think more highly of him than he did of
Hatzfeldt. He also referred to Radowitz and afterwards
to Radowitz’s father, alleging that the “Jesuitic attitude
of the latter was responsible for Olmütz.” “You know
what sort of a man the late King was,” he continued.
“For years, during which something might have been
done, Radowitz kept him occupied with all sorts of
tailoring and ornamental matters, with mediæval questions
of costumes, uniforms and coats of arms. He acted
as Keeper of the Wardrobe to his fancies: whether such
and such counts were or were not received, and the
Knights of St. John, and the Wetterau bench of Counts,
and the absurd question whether Saxony and Hanover
should retain the right to appoint envoys,&mdash;as if a
barber could not have intrigued successfully against our
policy so long as they had the power. He amused the
King with such trifles as these until it was too late.”</p>

<p>He then came to speak of Lady Bloomfield’s Memoirs,
the Tauchnitz edition of which he brought in from the
next room, and asked me to review it in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.
He said I should find “the genuine English arrogance
in the lady,” who was “much pleased at the opposition
of the Crown Princess (the present Empress Augusta);
and full of the profoundest aversion to everything
Prussian and German.” In 1866 she “had been anti-Prussian
to the backbone,” and had “libelled our officers
as the French did in 1870 with their story of the clock.”
In this connection he referred to the merino goats which
the Prussians were alleged to have driven away with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>
them from Bohemia. This led him to speak of the
Crown Princess and her “English self-conceit,” whereupon
I reminded him of the story of the silver plate of
the English shopkeepers and of the Prussian nobility
which he then repeated to me as before. On my remarking
that the Queen, her mother, was also unfriendly to
us Germans, and had always sided with the Belgian-Coburg
clique, &amp;c., he denied that this was the case, and
said that, on the contrary, she had “on the whole been
favourable to us.”</p>

<p>He then continued: “I wish you would some time
or other refute the charge that I have acted inconsistently
in the struggle with the Curia, and that I have
changed my opinions and aims in the ecclesiastical
question, and in others. That is the sort of criticism
which can only proceed from some one who has never
occupied the position of a leading Minister. Whoever
has held such a post for any considerable time can never
absolutely unalterably maintain and carry out his
original opinions. He finds himself in presence of
situations that are not always the same&mdash;of life and
growth&mdash;in connection with which he must take one
course one day, and then perhaps on the next another.
I could not always run straight ahead like a cannon ball.
(Doubtless a reminiscence of Schiller, ‘Piccolomini,’ <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, 4.)
Had I done so I should have knocked my head against
a wall. When the situation changed I was obliged to
alter my plans. Such changes in the situation were,
moreover, chiefly due to the fickleness of parties, and,
therefore, if any one is to blame they are. Their action,
on the other hand, was in great part influenced by their
envy. That is the national vice of the Germans. They
cannot bear to see any one hold a high and leading
position for any length of time. One of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>
important changes was produced by the formation of the
Catholic party, the founders of which might at the
beginning have been expected to support the Government.
Savigny, you know. It, however, weakened my
position. The entire struggle with the Centre party
would have taken another form, and have had a different
issue, if I could have fought it out at the head of the
Conservatives. I had risen from their ranks, but if I
was to do justice to the requirements of the time it was
impossible for me to continue in agreement with them
on all points. This, and the long-suppressed hatred and
envy of old comrades of my own class and faith, which
very soon broke out, drove me over to the Liberal side.
An understanding had to be come to with the latter if
the Empire was to strike firm root, and so I was obliged
to come to an agreement with the strongest party, a
thing which I had tried in vain to do in 1866, when it
was also desirable. It was particularly necessary in
those years when Germany was threatened with a Triple
Alliance like that of the Kaunitz period. The latest
achievement of German diplomacy is to have prevented
the formation of such a coalition against us for thirteen
years. The Government was forced to appear at the
head of the Liberals, at the head of the majority, in
order to avert this coalition. The Conservatives fell
away from me on that account. I would remind you of
the Inspection of Schools Bill, and of the attitude of
the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>, and of the libels published in the
<cite lang="de">Reichsglocke</cite>. And just as the situation was thus
altered at that time, so it was again changed in 1878,
through the defection of the Liberals. Here, too, it was
envy and self-importance, and the desire to rule. I was
no longer supported, or only in a lukewarm fashion.
They were not sorry to see me weakened by the opposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
of the Centre party, so that I should be forced to
negotiate with them. The Progressists combined with
the Centre against me. The Secessionists acted in very
much the same way. From this time forward the
National Liberals were silent in the struggle with Rome.
They were pleased at the embarrassments to which it
gave rise, and wished to have a weaker Government in
order that they might appear stronger. When the
Government had to strike the Liberals out of its reckoning,
it naturally followed that I had to slacken my
opposition to Rome. I cannot speak any longer now,
or the faceache will return.”</p>

<p>He then rose, but continued to speak of his illness
for a while as he walked up and down, describing it as
very painful, “like shingles.” I further asked if I
might in a few months send him the proofs of my
book. “What book?” he said. I answered: “That
which your Serene Highness has already twice promised
me to read through.” He then thought for a moment,
and promised once more to do so, whereupon I took my
leave, with wishes for his speedy recovery. He said he
had no longer any hope, and only expected to grow
worse. (...)</p>

<p>On the 11th of July, after the Chancellor had left
Berlin for Friedrichsruh, Grunow sent him the first
sheets of my book, <cite lang="de">Unser Reichskanzler</cite>, to read
through before they were sent to press. On the 16th
of July, Count Bill returned me these proofs, with the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Friedrichsruh</span>, 16/7, 1883.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p class="extra">“I enclose the proofs herewith. All that has
been struck out is a passage in a private conversation.
It would be better to omit altogether expressions of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span>
similar character made in conversations of a confidential
nature. (Of course, here and in what follows it is not
the writer, but the Chancellor who speaks.) Many
things may be said that are not suitable for publication;
among these are animadversions upon Imperial
institutions, such as the Constitution, for example.</p>

<p class="signoff1">“With much esteem,</p>
<p class="signature">
“<span class="smcap">Count W. Bismarck</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>The portion struck out appeared in the third sheet,
(page 31, in the first volume of the work as afterwards
printed, following the words “einmal zu Grunde gehen,”)
and ran: “Then it will be Bang! and snap goes the
German Constitution. There might be a repetition of
Schwarzenberg’s saying, ‘This arrangement has not
stood the test.’” The Prince has also corrected an
oversight (Vol. <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, p. 12, line 24), striking out the
syllable “<em>un</em>,” where I had written “<i lang="de" title="impossible">unmöglich</i>” by
mistake&mdash;evidence of the care with which he had read
it through.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, Count Bill returned more
proofs which were accompanied with the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p class="extra">“Although my father cannot act as collaborator
but must confine himself to a more negative part,
suggesting to you the suppression of incorrect or
unsuitable passages, he nevertheless requests you to
replace the portion within brackets on page 6, by the
enclosed, as the latter is more in harmony with the
facts.</p>

<p class="signoff1">
“With much esteem,</p>

<p class="signature">
“<span class="smcap">Count W. Bismarck</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span></p>

<p>The enclosure here referred to was dictated to Count
Bill, and appears in the book <cite lang="de">Unser Reichskanzler</cite>,
Vol. <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, pp. 54 and 55.</p>

<p>On the 20th of July further proofs, up to the end
of the first chapter, arrived from Friedrichsruh. These
again included alterations that had been dictated to
Count Bill by his father.</p>

<p>When the Prince shortly afterwards proceeded to
Kissingen, Grunow continued to send him the proofs,
as he had received no orders to the contrary. They
were not returned, and the printers had therefore to stop
work. I, however, received the following long letter
from the Chancellor, which was written by an
amanuensis on official foolscap, like a State document,
the two sheets being tied together with silk thread in
the Imperial colours.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Kissingen</span>, <i>August 3rd, 1883</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p class="extra">“You probably have no adequate conception of
the state of my health and of my need of rest or you would
doubtless not be the only person who begrudges me the
latter, while the Emperor and the Empire and all their
officials respect it. Possibly you have also no notion of
the difficulties of the work which you expect me to do.
On former occasions of a similar kind I have corrected
all errors of fact which had arisen through mistakes on
your part or on that of others. Now, however, you
wish to submit to the public with regard to my way of
thinking and my inner man inferences drawn from
observations made by yourself and others, which in great
part are actually incorrect. (He had then in his hands
Chapters <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> and <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, and a considerable portion of
Chapter <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>) It is, therefore, not surprising that your
conclusions do not correspond with the facts, so that if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>
were to publish them I should be forced to controvert
and refute them. There are a number of gross errors of
fact, and confusions of jest and earnest, in the expressions
and incidents upon which you base your view of
my supposed way of thinking. You assume that in
everything that I have ever said in your presence for
the entertainment of my guests at table, or in my own
home, or in what you have gathered from the unreliable
accounts of third persons, I have invariably given serious
expression to my inmost feelings with the conscientiousness
of a witness giving evidence on oath before a Court.</p>

<p>“In view of the pedantry with which you utilise
scattered fragments of conversation, a man in my position
would be obliged never to depart for a moment from a
formal mode of expressing himself or step down from his
official stilts. Everything you say in particular respecting
my attitude towards Christianity and the question
of the Jews is not only monstrously indiscreet, but
thoroughly false. (Everything?) The jokes about my
superstition have already appeared in print, and in so far
as there is any truth in them are just mere jokes or
consideration for the feelings of other people. I will
make one of a dinner party of thirteen as often as you
like, and am ready to undertake the most important and
delicate business on a Friday.</p>

<p>“At the present moment I am particularly interested
in setting public opinion right as to my share in the
Catholic question. What you give on the subject is
incomplete and superficial, and as soon as my health has
improved I should like to supply you with better
material. For that purpose it would be necessary that
I should see you personally as soon as I have finished
my cure. If I were to correct this and other points by
correspondence I should have to myself rewrite your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>
book. But I must be left absolutely in peace for the
duration of my Kissingen cure, and cannot occupy
myself editorially with such difficult and delicate questions
as those you touch upon.</p>

<p>“I would suggest to you to recast your book
altogether, as in its present form I do not believe it will
be favourably received. The work is far too lengthy,
and, in particular, it contains too much material published
long since by yourself and others. What is new in it is
in part of little interest, while other portions are incorrect,
so that I should be obliged publicly to dispute
their accuracy.</p>

<p>“I shall be very pleased to read the further proofs
in order to form an idea of the whole. When I have
done that, I can afterwards give you my opinion in
Berlin or Friedrichsruh, but while I remain here I must
decline every description of critical or editorial work.</p>

<p class="signature">
“(Signed) <span class="smcap"><abbr lang="de" title="von">v.</abbr> Bismarck</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>In reply to this communication, I excused myself for
having sent the proofs, through my ignorance of his
absolute need of rest, and by recalling the fact that, in
1878, I had been permitted to send him such proofs to
Kissingen and Gastein. The printing was then postponed
for about eight weeks, until the beginning of
October. On the 5th of that month I wrote to
Friedrichsruh to ask whether it was now agreeable to
him to receive me for the purpose of the interview which
he had mentioned as desirable in his letter of the 3rd of
August. On the 6th of October Count Herbert wrote
that his father would be glad to see me as soon as he
had read the proofs sent to him in the summer. Owing
to his journey and the state of his health he had not
been able to do so up to the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span></p>

<p>The work remained at a standstill for four weeks
more. This was very disagreeable to Grunow, who
repeatedly requested me to press the matter at Friedrichsruh.
I declined to do so, as <em>I</em> could wait. He then
wished to write to the Prince himself, describing his
embarrassment. I tried to dissuade him, but as he
nevertheless repeated the suggestion, I told him he
might do so at his own risk, and also gave him a few
ideas for his letter. Next day he told me that he had
written. On the 9th of November I received the
following letter from Friedrichsruh:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Friedrichsruh</span>, <i>November 8th, 1883</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p class="extra">“The Imperial Chancellor has received a
letter dated the 5th instant from Johannes Grunow,
publisher, of Leipzig, in which he urges despatch in the
supervision of the proofs of your work. The letter
contains the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘The manuscript was ready and in my hands eight
weeks ago, and I do not know what excuses to make
without prejudice to the truth unless I can communicate
to those who are pressing me the real cause of the
delay. This has not been done up to the present, but
if the delay should continue for any length of time it
will, to my great regret, be scarcely possible to avoid it,
unless I receive some other explanation.’</p>

<p>“It is obvious that the Imperial Chancellor cannot
continue a correspondence with a person who even now
threatens him with disclosures. On the contrary, he is
disposed to leave this gentleman to publish your work,
if he should think proper so to do, reserving to himself
the right of criticising it afterwards. Before he comes
to any decision on this point, however, he desires to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
discuss the matter with you verbally, and requests you
to visit him at Friedrichsruh, bringing with you your
copy of the proofs of your work.</p>

<p>“I beg of you to be good enough to let me know
shortly beforehand the day and hour of your arrival.</p>

<p class="signoff2">
“I am, honoured Sir, with profound esteem,</p>

<p class="signoff1">“Your most obedient,</p>

<p class="signature">“<span class="smcap">F. Rantzau</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>I thereupon announced that I should arrive at
Friedrichsruh on the 12th of November. I started on
the 11th, and, travelling <i lang="la" title="by way of">viâ</i> Berlin, reached Friedrichsruh
shortly after 12 o’clock on the following day.
I was met at the station by a servant, who accompanied
me to the Prince’s house and showed me to my room.
Shortly afterwards I was called downstairs, where I
had a friendly reception from the Chancellor and his
wife. We then took lunch, Rantzau being also present,
and immediately afterwards the Prince went with me
into his study in order to discuss the matter that had
brought me hither. He first gave expression to his
indignation at Grunow’s letter, in which connection I
also came in for my share. Among other things which
he said was: “You have turned me into a bookseller’s
hack; I am to be exploited like a Christmas speculation,
and harnessed to his cart, the impudent fellow! He
should have known nothing whatever of my assistance!”
I explained to him that I had to inform Grunow owing
to the possibility of a considerable delay in the return
of my proofs, that I had previously mentioned this to
him, the Chancellor, and that he had agreed, and that
the same course had been adopted in the case of the
first book. In his excitement he appeared to have overlooked
what I had said, as he went on as follows:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span>
“That must remain between ourselves. I can trust
you. You may write to me. But he! What right
has a bookseller got to correspond with me, to warn and
threaten me?” I tried in vain to appease him,
endeavouring to show that the passage quoted by
Rantzau when read in connection with the remainder of
the letter was perhaps not a threat, but only a strong
and not particularly felicitous expression of Grunow’s
difficulty and embarrassment. The latter was a man of
straightforward character, who knew how to keep his
own counsel, and who was incapable of wishing to bring
pressure of a threatening character to bear upon the
Chancellor, for whom he entertained the highest regard.
He then rang for Rantzau, and asked him to bring
Grunow’s letter, which he handed to me to read. I
could not see that it contained anything more than a
cry of distress on the part of the publisher, who had
promised the booksellers that a certain book would
appear at a fixed date, and who feared he could not
keep his word nor find any sufficient excuse to give
them. I was as little affected by this embarrassment as
I was by any loss which Grunow might suffer in case
the book was not published at Christmas. I could have
waited for a long time, and even if that were not the
case it would never have occurred to me to press him.
He said: “You acted in a perfectly proper way when
the matter was postponed, and I had not expected anything
different from you. But all the same that
remains a threat on his part, and a piece of presumption,
and I hesitated whether I should not decline to have
anything further to do with the book, and afterwards
publicly contradict erroneous passages in it. But then
I thought of you, although I altogether object to having
books written about me and to people trading with me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span>
and my affairs. Poschinger has done so, and sold my
despatches and letters, forgetting even to send me any
remuneration.” (Sometimes his humour does not desert
him even in his anger.) “Besides, this new book is not
so good as the preceding one. It does not contain much
that is new, and what it does is false. You are not
such a good observer as you were; you have grown
older; and you want to divine and picture my inner
man from fragmentary observations, which were mainly
misconceptions. You draw conclusions from occasional
utterances which you jotted down under the table-cloth.
According to you I am always in deadly earnest, as if I
were on oath, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>I abstained from urging what could be said on the
other side, and his excitement gradually subsided.
Taking some of the proofs he sat down at his writing-table
and invited me to take a place opposite, in order
that I might note down his corrections and additions.
He was rather impatient over it, said my hearing was
not so good as formerly, and complained that I did not
take down dictation as rapidly as his sons, and so on.
On this occasion we went through the greater part of the
third chapter, and he had very much less to object to
and alter than I had apprehended from his letter of the
3rd of August. By far the greater part of these pages
he turned over without any remarks. With respect to
the others he made observations that had no reference
to the book, as for instance: “Thadden, a narrow-minded
fellow, who has no brains.” After about three-quarters
of an hour he stood up and said: “I must now
get some fresh air.” He strode up and down the room,
however, for a while, as before, and began again to vent
his anger at the presumption and threats of “this bookseller
who wanted to harness me to his Christmas cart.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>
Ultimately, however, he quieted down, grew more
friendly, and showed me over the apartments, including
his bedroom. In one of the first of these was hung a
portrait in oils of a Roman prelate of high rank. In
reply to my inquiry he informed me that it was
Cardinal Hohenlohe.</p>

<p>He then went out for a walk or drive, while I
proceeded to my room and wrote out his observations
and the corrections which he had dictated to me. This
room, which contains pictures of Grant, Washington and
Hamilton, looks out on the park. After 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I paid a
visit to the Head Forester, Lange, with whom I took a
drive.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past six I was called to dinner. Among
those present, in addition to the Prince and Princess,
were the Rantzaus, Dr. Schweninger, of Munich, who
was in attendance on the Chancellor, and Herr von
Ohlen, another of the doctor’s patients. The Prince, as
I now observed for the first time, suffered from a slight
attack of jaundice. Schweninger (a man of lively
temperament, with dark hair and beard, who seems to
be very much at home here) diagnosed the Prince’s
ailment as chronic catarrh of the stomach, and has been
successful in his treatment. (...) While taking our
coffee, which was served in the Princess’s room, the conversation
was at first of little significance. It turned on
Becker’s portrait of the Prince during the Frankfurt
period, and on two groups of his male and female
ancestors, who from their costumes would appear to have
flourished in the time between the death of Luther and
the Thirty Years’ War, and on the portrait of his
sporting grandfather with the shot-gun, which was
formerly in Berlin, but has now found a place here too.
The conversation gradually grew more lively and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>
interesting; and the Chancellor, who had remarked in
the <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with me at midday that he would henceforth
be careful of what he said in my presence, had
probably forgotten his intention. On my stating, among
other things, that the war of 1870 appeared to have had
an excellent effect upon the national feeling in Saxony,
he added, “and still more so in Bavaria. I once said
jestingly to Fabrice<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that we should live to see order
restored in Saxony one day by Bavarian troops.” Speaking
of Court circles in Berlin, he complained: “Whenever
I performed on the political tight-rope they hit me on
the shins, and, if I had only fallen, how delighted they
would have been! Particularly the eternal feminine
(das ewig Weibliche).”</p>

<p>It was only after lunch on Tuesday, the 13th, and
again before dinner, that the work with the Prince was
resumed, when Chapter <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, the remainder of Chapter
III., and about half of Chapter <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> were weeded out, the
weeds again proving much less abundant than I had
anticipated. He maintained that in the second chapter
I made him out to be a “hypocrite” in religious matters,
an idea which he had no difficulty in entirely disproving,
inasmuch as he justified his belief in God among other
things by a reference to facts which could only be
accounted for by the existence of a Deity.</p>

<p>In the second section he began to dictate to me an
account of his attitude towards the Kulturkampf, which
he broke off on our being called to dinner. Before that
he again suddenly renewed his grumbling at Grunow, I,
too, coming in for a small share. He was also displeased
with my long full beard. “My wife asked me,” he said,
“if you were older than I. ‘No,’ I said, ‘I thought you
were four or five years younger.’ But she was right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>
It’s your beard. It should be cut shorter. As it is it
makes you look fearfully ancient.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 14th, the Chief set to work on
the proofs with me after breakfast. At Chapter <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> he
exclaimed: “Look here, you must have a thoroughly
wicked heart. You are delighted every time you hear
and can jot down a disagreeable remark about somebody.”
I rejoined: “I cannot trust myself to give any
opinion upon my own heart. But one thing I do know, it
has always been devoted to you. I only hate your
enemies.” He afterwards reflected for a moment, looked
at the clock, and said: “I must now go out to receive
Giers, who is coming from Berlin to discuss important
matters with me. We shall introduce you and
Schweninger to him as doctors of medicine, for if he
ascertained that Dr. Busch belonged to another variety
he would be afraid that he was being watched and that
it would get into the newspapers. By the way, you have
included him among the Jews in your diplomatic chapter,
and that must be struck out. (I had referred to his
name, Giers, as a russified form of Hirsch.) He may be
a Jew, although he asserts that he is the son of a
Finnish officer. But we must not write that, as he is
well disposed, desires peace, and does what he can to
secure it. He is quite indispensable to us.”</p>

<p>The Russian Minister arrived between 2 and 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
The Chancellor received him at the station, drove with
him to the house, and then conferred with him until
nearly 6 o’clock, when Giers dined with us, the company
remaining together over their coffee until about 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
Giers is a man of medium height, and would seem to be
well advanced in the fifties. He has somewhat of a
stoop as he walks. His features are of a slightly Jewish
cast, a characteristic which is also evident in his gestures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>
and movements, there being something in the hands in
particular which recalled our Semites. On this occasion
he spoke only in French.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 15th, I wrote in my diary: Giers
went off again last night about 10 o’clock, and
Schweninger and Ohlen left at noon to-day. I took
lunch with the Prince’s family, Count William being
also present. The Prince, who, by the way, now
observes great moderation in diet and drinks only the
lightest wines, read despatches, and gave Rantzau
instructions for replying to them. The subjects were
Bulgarian affairs, and the North Sea and Baltic Canal.
I then retired to my room to work, and afterwards made
an excursion to the Aumühl. As I was about to return
I saw the Chief coming towards me in a carriage.
When he recognised me he reached out both hands
towards me from a distance, left the carriage, and
walked back with me to the mill. (I therefore fancy
that he cannot have been so very angry with me.) He
described to me a pretty pathway through the woods on
the other side of the streamlet, saying: “I know you are
also a lover of lonely country walks.” Yesterday evening
over our coffee, after Giers had left, he also said: “I
always feel happiest in my top-boots, striding through
the heart of the forest, where I hear nothing but the
knocking and hammering of the woodpecker, far away
from your civilisation.”</p>

<p>Again at work with the Chancellor from 4 o’clock
onwards. He told me his wife had said: “The doctor
may be very clever and amiable, but all the same you
should be on your guard at table when he is present.
He always sits there with his ears cocked, writes everything
down, and then spreads it abroad.” She herself,
however, in her simple way, forgot to keep on her guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>
to-day. While seated on her right at dinner my napkin
accidentally dropped, and, lo and behold! her Serene
Highness, the lady of the house, bent down for it before
I could prevent her! I felt that I had been fearfully
awkward.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 16th, the Chief dictated to me the
conclusion of the long passage respecting his attitude
towards the ecclesiastical struggle. He then gave me,
for insertion in the fourth chapter, the following statement
with regard to Bunsen:&mdash;“During the Crimean
War, when he was Minister in London, he reported to
Berlin that England offered us Schleswig-Holstein in
return for our joining in the war against Russia, whilst
he stated in London that Prussia would join if she
received the Duchies. Both statements were false, and
when the affair became known, he was dismissed. I
had something to say in the matter. The King
exclaimed: ‘Why, he has been my friend for twenty
years, and now he acts in this way!’ Old General
Rauch observed: ‘Yes, he has also lied and betrayed
your Majesty for twenty years.’ ‘One cannot allow
that to be said of a friend,’ rejoined the King.” He
then proceeded to other matters, and on my asking
whether there was any subject which I could deal with
in the press, he at first replied in the negative, but then
said: “Giers found the Emperor very frail, and perhaps
he will not last much longer. Well, when he dies, I
shall go too. He is a gallant old gentleman, who has
always meant well, and whom I must not desert. But
I will make no experiments with the Crown Prince. I
am too old and weak for that. Things will not go on
particularly well, and on the whole I am convinced that
what we have built up since 1866 has no stability.”
In the course of his further remarks he mentioned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>
Crown Princess, “a Liberal Englishwoman,” “a follower
of Gladstone,” and maintained that she “has more
influence upon her consort than is desirable.” He then
spoke once more of his need of repose and a country
life, referring to Berlin in very disparaging terms, and
scarcely allowing it even to be a handsome city. He
insisted that owing to the drainage there was already
a bad smell in every house, and that in a short time,
the place would become utterly intolerable. He said in
conclusion: “I have always longed to get away from
large cities and the stink of civilisation. Every time I
return I feel that more and more, and I have earned my
leisure.” I remarked that I could fully understand that
feeling, and also his reluctance to serve the coming
King, on account of his opinions; but surely he would
not abandon a work which was so entirely his own, and
retire altogether from the political stage. He would at
least take his seat in the Upper Chamber and be elected
to the Reichstag, where he could offer advice and
admonition. He replied: “Yes, but not like the others
in perpetual and uncompromising opposition.” I said,
“Then please remember this little fellow when you
want anything done in the press. I shall always be at
your service.” “All right,” he replied, and reached me
his hand. “You can then come to me and arrange my
papers. (With a significant smile.) There is still a great
deal of good stuff there.” I begged leave to remain
the following day, as it was such a pleasure to me to be
near him. “Oh, certainly!” he said; “but you must
not ask me to play cards with you or otherwise entertain
you.”</p>

<p>I remained over the 17th, made several excursions
on foot through the woods to the east and west, and was
present in the evening after dinner when Lange made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span>
his report as to the administration of the estate. I
started for Berlin at noon on the 18th, and returned to
Leipzig on the 19th. There I received in instalments
from Rantzau the bulk of the remaining proofs. The
Chief sent two more to Bucher in Berlin, whence I had
to fetch them.</p>

<p>I immediately noted down the following particulars
of the conversation I had with Bucher on this occasion.
I praised the Countess Rantzau as being good-natured
and unaffected. “Well,” he rejoined, “she is cleverer
and more prudent than her mother. The Princess, for
instance, is not fortunate in the selection of her acquaintances.
First she had the little hunchback Obernitz.
Then Babette, Meyer was her friend and confidant&mdash;an
intelligent body, but.... She was often with her
in Berlin and elsewhere, and as the Princess heard a great
deal about political affairs and spoke of them to others,
Babette, while she was with her, certainly overheard
many things and then repeated them to others....
It was afterwards Frau von Wallenberg’s turn. She was
the worst, and she it was who had most opportunity for
eavesdropping and keeping other people informed. You
know that the Prince generally goes through his official
papers at lunch time, and gives instruction to his sons or
to Rantzau as to the answers to be returned. She could
hear all that, and take note of it for Holstein, who has
recently developed, owing to his ambition, into a very
dangerous intriguer. He is accustomed to communicate
to Paulchen (Hatzfeldt, the Secretary of State), everything
he ascertains in this and other ways.”</p>

<p>I turned the conversation on Bucher’s share in the
negotiations respecting the candidature of the Prince of
Hohenzollern for the Spanish throne. He gave me a
detailed account of this. The first time he was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span>
Madrid in connection with that affair was in Easter and
then in June, 1870.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He gave the following particulars
of his second journey: “It was a rush hither and
thither in zigzag, accident playing a large part in delaying
and hindering as well as in promoting my purpose.
Salazar came to me on the Saturday, and wanted to have
the final decision of the Prince by Monday. I replied
that that would not be possible in such a short time,
particularly as I did not know where the Prince was
staying at the moment, and of course he would have to
be consulted first. Nor was it an easy matter for me to
get away at the time. He said he knew the Prince was
in Reichenhall, and added, ‘<i lang="fr" title="Going by what you say, I give up">Selon ce que vous me dites
je renonce</i>.’ I replied: ‘I assume that you will write a
statement of what has passed between us, which will
find its way into the Spanish archives; and as they will
some day be open to historians, I should not wish to
take this responsibility upon myself. I will travel with
you, first to Madrid, (improbable, but so I heard it,) and
then to the Prince of Hohenzollern.’ He said he would
take one of his liegemen with him, a man who would
fling himself out of the window without hesitation if he
told him to do so. A curious condition of things still prevails
there, the obedience of feudal vassals, the devotion
of the age of chivalry. Well, we started for Reichenhall,
travelling first in separate compartments so as to
avoid notice in Paris, and afterwards together, as he did
not understand German and his companion spoke only
Spanish. On my making inquiries at the office of the
baths, I found that the director was at a neighbouring
village, and the others could give me no information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>
respecting the Prince. They believed he was not there.
I drove out to the village they mentioned and found
that the director had left. On returning to Reichenhall
I proceeded to the police station. As I was going up
the steps I was met by a rather shabbily-dressed man,
who stopped and said he supposed I wanted to go to the
police office, but it was now closed. He, however,
belonged to it, and would go back with me. I told him
I was looking for the Prince of Hohenzollern, to whom
I had a communication to make. He replied that the
Prince was here, and lived at such-and-such a place, but
under another name. I therefore proceeded thither with
Salazar, but only found the Princess, who told us that
her consort was now with his father at Sigmaringen. We
packed up once more and made off for Sigmaringen,
where we found them, and they agreed. They could,
however, decide nothing without the consent of the
King, who was at Ems. We then started for that place,
and were received by the old gentleman, who was very
gracious to me and agreed to what I submitted to him.
I then went to Varzin to report to the Chief. It was
a regular zigzag journey with obstacles.” Bucher added
that he had taken shorthand notes of his conversation
with Salazar, which he “still possessed.” At least, so I
understood him.</p>

<p>On the whole the Prince in his collaboration with me
struck out a little over seventeen pages out of a total of
nearly 900, while he contributed some twenty-two pages
to the two volumes. The first edition of 10,000 copies
was issued at the end of February 1884, and by the
autumn of 1885, 6,500 copies had been disposed of,
although the Liberal press did its worst to run the book
down. An English translation was published by Macmillan
in April, and some months later arrangements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>
were made for an Italian edition. (This translation, by
Brandi, was only published at Milan in the spring of
1888.)</p>

<p>On the 14th of March, 1884, I again took up my
residence in Berlin; and on the 16th I called upon
Bucher, to present him with a handsomely bound copy
of my book, <cite lang="de">Unser Reichskanzler</cite>. He had already
got it, however, and had read it through without coming
across any inaccuracies. He made three suggestions for
some supplementary material on the issue of a new
edition.</p>

<p>According to Bucher, the Chancellor had returned
this time from Friedrichsruh in excellent condition, had
already been twice out riding in the Thiergarten, and
once for a walk there. He had drawn up a memorandum
for the Emperor, showing that the home policy of
Gladstone, the extension of the franchise, must lower the
position of the English aristocracy and with it that of the
Crown, which was of course only its head. The Emperor’s
minute said that he was much struck with this
statement, and suggested that it should be laid before
the Crown Prince&mdash;a suggestion to which the Chief
agreed. In Bucher’s opinion the Chancellor would on
certain conditions consent to remain in office when the
Crown Prince came to the throne, but the latter would
not keep his promises, and then Bismarck would retire.
A further communication of Bucher’s was also interesting,
namely, that the “refutation of the absurd attack of the
<cite lang="de">National Zeitung</cite>” (on my account of Gablentz’s
mission), which was contained in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</cite> was written by the Prince himself.</p>

<p>A few days after this visit to Bucher I wrote to the
Imperial Chancellor, informing him that I was again a
resident of Berlin, and begging him in case there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span>
was anything I could do for him in the press to kindly
let me know when I might call upon him to take his instructions.
I received no answer to this letter. My
intercourse with Bucher continued. On the 3rd of July,
he sent me a card informing me of his departure for
Laubbach, near Coblenz.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July, I received the following letter
which had been returned owing to an incorrect address
and then re-despatched:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Kissingen</span>, <i>June 30th, 1884</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p class="extra">“Rarely has a book excited my interest to such a
degree as your <cite lang="de">Unser Reichskanzler</cite>, which I have
perused whilst taking the waters here. As it will have
produced a like impression upon others a new edition
will soon be required. I therefore consider it my duty
to call your attention to an error which I have also
noticed in the French and English newspapers. The
letter of the Minister President of the 26th of December,
1865, which was made public entirely against my
will and in consequence of a gross indiscretion which
has not yet been quite cleared up, was not addressed to
the clergyman, Roman von André, but to the <i lang="de">Rittergutsbesitzer</i>,
Andrae-Roman. In addition to this you
will allow me to correct a few of the following observations,
as, for instance, that on page 158. I have always
spoken and written to Prince Bismarck not from a
clergyman’s standpoint, but with the consciousness that
in matters of faith our views were identical, and with a
feeling of hearty affection for his powerful individuality,
having fully recognised his greatness long before he
became a public character.</p>

<p>“Allow me to add one further remark. The somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
cool attitude adopted by Bismarck towards the
clergy as such did not originate in the conflict with the
<cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>. It existed long before that date, and
was closely connected with a similar attitude towards
the Church, and arises from entirely different causes,
which I need not enter into here. That clergymen, or,
indeed, laymen, in signing ‘the Declaration’ made
themselves sponsors for any of the vile and malicious
calumnies, which&mdash;I regret to say&mdash;were at that time
heaped upon the great man, I must dispute until that
charge has been proved in some specific case. I speak
only of those Conservatives who hold the same religious
belief as Bismarck. I was pained and surprised to find
for the first time in a letter addressed by the Prince to
my friend von Holtz during the General Synod, that he
entertained this view. I immediately put myself in
communication with a considerable number of my co-signatories
to the declaration who were present in
Berlin at that time, and <em>all</em> those with whom I spoke
on the subject agreed with me that the public declaration
by Bismarck (I have neither this nor the text of
the declaration itself with me at the present moment)&mdash;his
declaration, namely, that ‘after the unfortunate
articles in question no <em>respectable</em> person <em>could</em> continue
to read the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>,’ was the sole cause of the
counter-declaration, that we considered ourselves to be
respectable persons, although we continued to read the
<cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>. It does not contain a word of approval
of any ‘vile and malicious calumnies.’ I have never
read nor approved of the <cite lang="de">Reichsglocke</cite>. The statements
respecting the death of my relative, Herr von
Wedemeyer, are also very hazardous, and would be
difficult to prove. It was at that time decided to send
to the Prince a joint statement, which was to be drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span>
up by me. At the desire, however, of a person closely
connected with the Prince this decision was altered, and
it was arranged that each should write separately to him
in the sense indicated above. This was done in a great
number of cases. There are, however, different kinds
of Conservatives. The most reliable, if not always the
most pliant, those who hold the same religious belief as
the Prince, have always been and will ever remain on
his side.</p>

<p class="signoff1">
“With the most profound respect,</p>

<p class="signature">“<span class="smcap">A. Andrae-Roman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the 23rd September I called upon Bucher, who
had undergone a course of massage and hygienic gymnastics
at Laubbach, and had been back in Berlin for
about five weeks. He again complained of the “shocking
way in which business was conducted in the Foreign
Office”; and in particular of Hatzfeldt and Holstein.
For a long time past he had given up saluting the latter.
He would “like best of all to leave the place, if that
were only possible.” He praised Count Herbert as
“very diligent and not unskilful,” and was of opinion
that the Prince intended to make him Secretary of State
at some future time. Münster, “who is more English than
German, and does very little,” having allowed some
question to hang fire, the Chief sent Herbert to London,
where he at once took it into his own hands, pressed it
through, and finally settled it satisfactorily. “Another
person placed in the position of the Ambassador would
have resigned in such circumstances.” I suggested:
“Angra Pequena, and the long delay in answering the
Chancellor’s inquiries?” Bucher replied in the affirmative.
He then said: “It will not be pleasant to work under
the young man, but work will be done, and things will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>
not be allowed to drag on in such a slow and slovenly
way. Herbert has also a good memory, and has been a
great deal with his father. He was often present at
interviews with important personages, at which matters
of great moment were discussed that do not appear
in the official documents, and in that way he has had
splendid opportunities for learning.” Bucher agreed
with me regarding the meeting at Skiernevice as a
“spectacle intended to show Europe the good understanding
which exists between the three Emperors.” He
added, however, that “the relations between Austria
and Russia leave much to be desired in many respects.”
He furthermore confirmed the fact that the Chief, “in
view of the cool and repellent attitude of Gladstone, has
for a long time past been working towards a better
understanding with France, and not without success.”
After speaking of the Balkan Peninsula, and hinting at
an understanding respecting it, Bucher said he had a
mind to write something on the despatch of an English
Commission to Sarakhs for the purpose of settling the
question of the frontier between Afghanistan and Russia,
but he had not yet been able to collect the geographical
materials. These remarks showed that he had been
busy with this question recently. I offered to publish
something of the kind in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, and he promised
the necessary materials from the library of the
Foreign Office, and in particular the account of
O’Donovan’s travels. He saw the Prince (who has now
returned to Friedrichsruh) a short time ago; he thinks
that the journey to Skiernevice has done him good, as
he is much less stout, feels thoroughly well and also
works hard.</p>

<p>Bucher called at my house at 8.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the
following morning with a collection of newspaper extracts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>
on various subjects for my use. I had, however,
gone out. On my returning the bundle of papers given
to me on the 28th of September he gave me some further
particulars of the way in which Herbert had dealt with
the English. On Lord Granville asking him in the
course of the negotiations respecting Angra Pequena
whether we were not contemplating an ultimate expansion
of territory towards the interior (Query, towards
the East, in the direction of Bechuanaland and the Boer
Republic), he retorted, not over politely, that that was
“a question of mere curiosity,” and indeed finally, “a
matter that does not concern you.” The Chief showed
him the letter in which that was reported, and was
pleased with his son’s sturdiness. The English have now
so far yielded in the matter that the Ministry has not
confirmed the resolution of the Cape Government to
annex the country around Angra Pequena. “Münster,”
he said, “must leave London, but I doubt whether there
is any truth in the report that Herbert has been selected
as his successor.” He afterwards said: “When the
Germans, a short time before the conclusion of the Preliminary
Peace at Versailles, sank some English coal
ships on the Lower Seine and the English made a row
on the subject, the Chief asked me, ‘What can we say
in reply?’ Well, I had brought with me some old
fogies on the Law of Nations and such matters. I
hunted up what the old writers called the <i lang="la">jus angariæ</i>,
that is to say, the right to destroy the property of
neutrals on payment of full compensation, and showed
it to the Chief. He sent me with it to Russell, who
allowed himself to be convinced by this ‘good authority.’
Shortly afterwards the whole affair with the <i lang="la">jus
angariæ</i> appeared in <cite>The Times</cite>. We wrote in the
same sense to London, and the matter was settled. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span>
short time ago, when I had to look up something in the
documents of the war period, I found that the two papers
which I had written in this matter were gone. They
had been removed by our mutual friend Abeken through
jealousy of me.” I reminded him of O’Donovan’s work,
but he said that just now the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article would
be premature. In this connection he gave me a short
survey of the relations of the English and the Russians
in Afghanistan, which showed that he was fully informed
on that subject. I finally suggested that I should now
give a description in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> of the scandalous
treatment of Ireland by England, based upon Lecky’s
book, which he promised to get for me from the Foreign
Office library, but which I already had. I wrote the
article which appeared shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The Prince having returned from Friedrichsruh, I
wrote to him (on the 27th of October), requesting him,
in case he wished anything said in the press respecting
the Brunswick question or any other topic of the day,
to let me know when I might have the honour of
receiving information as to his intentions in the matter.</p>

<p>This letter also remained unanswered. It would
therefore appear that the Chancellor will have no
further intercourse with me, having apparently taken
offence at something or other. His will be done! And
so we bring the diary to a close.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Supplementary.</span></h3>

<p>Bucher frequently mentioned to me that South
African affairs were also of importance to us. On my
expressing my readiness to deal with the subject in the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, he promised me material for the purpose,
and twice I reminded him of his promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span></p>

<p>On the 3rd of November, 1884, he wrote me: “I
cannot yet spare the documents on South Africa, as they
may be required for use any day. You will doubtless
have noticed this from the articles in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>. Besides, this is not the right
moment. You must first know what the Boers have
to say in reply to the accusations of the English.</p>

<p>“In the meantime another article would be desirable
in No. 47 on the debate in <cite>The Times</cite> of the 1st instant.
I have done some of the preparatory work for you in
this matter, and send you herewith for perusal a
bundle of papers in which you will find a variety of
material. The subject of Protection in England must,
it is true, be dealt with very cautiously, as it is in our
interest that England should maintain her present
tariff, and we must bear that in mind.</p>

<p>“It is absurd to believe that the tariff question is
governed by any absolute principle which applies to all
peoples and all times. Every nation must know or
must learn from experience what is best for itself. We
therefore do not dream of teaching the English, although
they are so generously anxious to teach us, and although
the change from the system of natural forces
(by which, since 1815, the preceding generation of
Prussian statesmen raised the country to prosperity)
to the free-trade doctrines that have been accepted by
the official world and the majority of the legislative
bodies since 1850, must be ascribed in great part to
English writers, and German journalists paid by England.
Now of the complaints that are being raised in England,
one has an obvious application to the condition of
affairs in Germany, namely, that which relates to foreign
competition in agricultural produce and cattle breeding.
Then you can deal with the arguments of the other side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
that a return to Protection is impossible in England,
recognising at the same time that there are sound
reasons for this contention. Conclusion: we also can
suggest no remedy; probably this extraordinary state
of affairs must be a consequence of the peculiar development
of England&mdash;on the Continent the Thirty
Years’ War, the Spanish War of Succession and the
Napoleonic Wars (1870 was also a ‘wonderful year for
England’ in consequence of our war). The peoples of
the Continent rend each other to pieces in wars and
revolutions. England, which, with the exception of the
unimportant French landing in Ireland, has seen no
enemy on her soil since 1066, is ‘making money’ and
helping herself to the best colonies. If, as there is
every reason to believe, we are now on the eve of a long
era of peace in Europe, those conditions will no longer
exist under which the wealth of England has, as
Gladstone says, increased by leaps and bounds.” I
wrote this article immediately, on the lines laid down
by Bucher, and basing it on his material. It appeared
in No. 47 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November Bucher again sent me
material for an attack upon England. This I worked
up into an article entitled “England and the Cholera,”
which was published in No. 49 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.
This article argued that England had destroyed hand
weaving in the East Indies by its customs legislation
of 1817, thus depriving large numbers of people of
their livelihood. This, together with the bad harvests,
resulted in famine, which in turn weakened the population
and made it less capable of resisting the cholera
which arose through malaria, heat and overcrowding at
the places of pilgrimage, and which accordingly assumed
an epidemic form! England was also responsible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>
the extension of the scourge to West Africa and Europe,
as, in order not to disturb her trade and shipping, she
exercised no proper supervision.</p>

<p>On the 24th of November I again called upon
Bucher to remind him of the promised documents from
the Foreign Office respecting the struggle between the
English and the Boers. He said that just now in
particular it was impossible to spare them, or at least
those of a later date than 1879, as the Chief and
Hatzfeldt might want them for reference any day. He
would, however, send me the earlier papers, though he
really ought not to let any of them leave his hands.
He is of opinion that England is afraid of a war with
the Dutch element in South Africa, and that Warren
would certainly not be able to recruit his volunteers
except among the English settlers there. He then said:
“Just keep a sharp look-out on the news from Afghanistan.
Something will happen there soon.” I said:
“I suppose the English expedition which left Quetta
to take part in the settlement of the frontier has
arrived?” He replied: “No, it has only got as far as
Herat. But General Lumsden, who has gone by way of
Teheran, is already on the frontier, and has discovered
that an important point, Puli Khatun (the women’s
bridge&mdash;the men ride through the stream beside it) a
place as to which a decision had yet to be arrived at,
was already in the possession of the Russians. The
<cite>Daily News</cite>, the organ of the Government, is surprised
at this, and complains of the action of the Russians.
The Chief will probably have something on the subject
written for the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>. Of course it cannot go
into the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche</cite>.”</p>

<p>I then asked if there was any truth in the report that
Busch, who, by the way, is married to a Jewess, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>
shortly leave and be given a Legation. Bucher replied
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I: “Herbert will then be his successor?”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, certainly.”</p>

<p>I: “In that case Hatzfeldt’s position will be rather
shaky.”</p>

<p>He: “Certainly, he will then be superfluous, and
that is doubtless the Chief’s intention. Herbert will
then read through the despatches with him at breakfast,
and the Chief will explain what is to be done with
them, so that Herbert will bring everything ready
prepared for us to deal with.”</p>

<p>On the 28th of November Bucher’s servant brought
me three thick bundles of Foreign Office documents on
the Transvaal question. I made extracts from these, and
returned them to him personally five days later. They
consisted of English blue books, and of despatches from
Münster, Count Herbert Bismarck, Alvensleben at the
Hague, and the German Consul in Cape Town. They
extended over the periods from the 16th July, 1881, to
the 31st of March, 1882; from the 1st of April, 1882, to
November of the same year; and from December, 1882, to
the 15th of March, 1884. These I worked up into three
articles, under the title of “England and the Boers,” which
appeared in the first three numbers of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> for
the year 1885. These were followed immediately afterwards
by an article on “Santa Lucia Bay,” in No. 4, which
concluded with a statement by Bucher; and one on “England
and Russia in Asia,” which was also suggested by him,
and for which he had sent me extracts from the English
newspapers, together with O’Donovan’s book on Merv.
The latter article appeared in No. 6 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.
Together with the documents there was also a very
violent appeal (in English, and printed on red paper) to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>
the nations of Europe to help the Boers, on which Bucher
had written, “You may keep this.”</p>

<p>(Here follow some letters exchanged between Dr.
Busch and Herr A. Andrae-Roman, which led to the
interview of the 18th of February.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Translator.</span>)</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th of February I called
upon Andrae, who was staying with Knak, the pastor of
the Bohemian Lutheran community, at his residence,
No. 29 Wilhelmstrasse. He introduced the pastor to me
as his son-in-law. My visit lasted from 8.45 to 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
Andrae is a tall stately man, with a white full beard,
apparently well on in the sixties. From his accent a
Hanoverian, he himself said that he came from East
Friesland. He first repeated that, owing to the unfortunate
experience he had had he must be cautious in
what he said, and that he doubted whether we could
understand each other, as from my book I appeared to
have a different religious standpoint to his. With
regard to the first point, he referred to Bismarck’s letter
to him, published by Hesekiel, of which he said: “I
really do not know how it came to be published. I read
and showed it to some intimate friends, but I never
allowed it to go out of my own hands. But it impresses
itself strongly on the memory, so that a Schleswig-Holstein
ecclesiastic of high rank actually knew it by
heart. It was moreover printed, not in the first place
by Hesekiel, but by a democratic newspaper.” He likewise
referred to Diest-Daber, who also went very
thoroughly into things, and immediately noted down
everything he ascertained; describing him as “clever
and in reality honourable.” He had attacked Bismarck
owing to a communication from Moritz von Blankenburg,
which was based upon a misunderstanding. I
endeavoured to dissipate Andrae’s mistrust, observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span>
that anything he might now tell me on the subject in
question was not intended for immediate use in the
press, and should not be published at all without his
permission, at least certainly not before Bismarck’s
death. I was only collecting for history, which would
ultimately claim its rights. As to the difference of our
religious views, I told him that I had studied theology,
and had adopted theosophical ideas, and in this connection
mentioned Jacob Böhmen. Andrae was intimately
acquainted with Bismarck many years ago, had
visited him at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, and afterwards on
several occasions in Berlin. He added: “Indeed I may
go so far as to say that I was for a long time on terms
of close friendship with him. Formerly he listened
with pleasure and with great patience to the views of
others. Of course whether he was guided by them was
a different matter. Probably that is now no longer the
case, which would be natural enough with one who has
achieved such great things&mdash;and at the same time
has had so much good fortune.” He then went on to
speak with the greatest admiration of Bismarck’s extraordinary
political genius, was convinced that he was a
“sincere Christian,” and assured me that he “made no
secret of the fact even as long since as the Frankfurt
period. But then, and even before that time, he showed
coolness towards the clergy and the Church.”</p>

<p>I: “I beg your pardon, but how do you mean that?
What do you understand by the Church? The entire
Christian community, the faithful, the community of
saints; or the institution with certain observances and
means of salvation, sacraments, public forms of divine
service, sermons, &amp;c.?”</p>

<p>He replied that the latter conception was what he
had in mind. He then continued: “It is an old story
with him, and connected with the manner of his conversion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>
At that time the clergy in Pomerania were not
what they are at the present day. The majority of them
were Rationalists, and when the change took place it did
not originate with them, but with a few laymen, like
Below, (not Below-Hohendorf, as I interrupted him to
suggest,) Senfft-Pilsach, and Thadden. They came forward
to a certain extent as preachers, and as the clergy
held and preached rationalistic views, often in opposition
to them&mdash;in sectarian opposition. Blankenburg, and
Bismarck’s father-in-law in Reinfeld, an excellent old
gentleman, were also of the number. Their views somewhat
approached those of Gichtel. Others inclined to
the old Lutheran doctrines. (Therefore not to those of
the Moravian Brethren, as I had supposed.) Bismarck
came under their influence and joined them. Hence his
coolness towards the clergy and the Church. (Gichtel’s
‘Gott in uns,’ and Bismarck’s ‘Nicht durch Predigermund
sich erbauen’&mdash;‘Seek not edification from the mouth of
the preacher.’) It was not due to the clerical signatures
at foot of the Declaration.”</p>

<p>He then went on to say that Bismarck misunderstood
“the Declaration.” According to him, Holtz wrote to the
Prince that he regretted having had a hand in it.
Bismarck was greatly pleased at this, and wrote Holtz a
long letter expressing his satisfaction. Andrae disapproved
of the step taken by his friend Holtz, “as an
individual demonstration,” and suggested that the signers
of “the Declaration” should send a joint explanation
of its real meaning to the Chancellor, and reject the false
construction put upon it, namely, that they wished to
express their approval of the articles in the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>.
They wanted to adopt this course, but Bismarck informed
them, through Limburg Stirum, that he did not wish
them to do so, and would prefer that they should write
to him separately. In that way the idea of a collective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span>
explanation was dropped. Andrae is of opinion that the
intercourse between Moritz von Blankenburg and the
Prince still continues, although they only see each other
on rare occasions. “There was never an absolute breach
between them, as their wives continued to meet as they
still do.”</p>

<p>We then spoke about the Kulturkampf, and Andrae
expressed his surprise that Bismarck should have entered
upon it, as he must have known that a struggle with a
spiritual power had no prospect of success. His action
was doubtless determined by the creation of the Centre
party. I defended him on the lines of the statement
dictated to me at Friedrichsruh.</p>

<p>The conversation then turned upon the relations between
the Chief and the Emperor. Andrae said of the
latter: “His merit lies in the creation of the new army,
and in the fact that he recognised the right men and held
firmly to them.” He added the following anecdote: “A
Minister who could no longer endure his position by the
side of Bismarck tendered his resignation to the Emperor.
The latter urged him to remain. ‘We must all
learn to be patient,’ he said. The Minister nevertheless
resigned. The Emperor, on the other hand, did not
part with Bismarck, considering it his duty to retain
him.” I observed: “It was a case of necessity; it
would have been impossible to get on without him.”
Andrae replied: “Yes, but the Emperor’s merit was in
recognising that fact.”</p>

<p>Andrae then talked a great deal about Hanover,
saying that the clergy there “were willing to yield
obedience to the authorities who had power over them.”
He proceeded: “Before the war of 1866, we, the
Conservatives, were divided into two parties&mdash;Gerlach
and Marquart, and, on the other hand, those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>
considered a war with Austria inevitable. Ultimately
an effort was made to bring about an understanding, and
we invited Gerlach to attend a meeting, accompanied by
a few others of his way of thinking, in order that he
should not be alone. He agreed and came, when he
made the following prophecy: ‘There are only two
possible results: either we are defeated, and then it is
all over with us, and there will be a partition of Prussia;
or we are victorious, and then we must have a Liberal
<i lang="fr">régime</i>, as that is the only way in which, unification of
Germany under Prussia can be brought about.’ And so
it has come to pass. Bismarck demanded an indemnity,
and then for many years worked in harmony with the
Liberals, so far as that was possible.”</p>

<p>As I was leaving Andrae promised to give me further
information later on in case I asked for it. “But not
in writing. I frequently come to Berlin, and shall be
glad to meet you again.”</p>

<p>I continued in regular communication with Bucher
during the year 1885. I visited him on New Year’s
Day; called at his house on the 11th of February to
return O’Donovan’s <cite>Oasis of Merv</cite>, but could not see
him, as he lay ill in bed; a few days later we had a
short talk on the Lucia Bay question; and again on the
25th of February I had a long conversation with him at
his lodgings. At first we spoke about the Chief, whose
health, he said, was now thoroughly restored. He was
“quite young and rosy,” and was “working fearfully
hard.” The conversation then turned on Hatzfeldt, who
“got sick with fear at the thought that he might have
to take part in the West African Conference, and that
the Chief might appoint him to represent the Foreign
Office in the Reichstag, and so took a holiday....
There is really nothing the matter with him, but he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span>
managed to obtain a long leave of absence. As Herbert
is now there, it is a question whether he will return any
more. And we shall not miss him, either. Business
will be done as well, or better, in his absence. He
would certainly have been removed from his post as
Secretary of State before this if they only knew where
to put him.” I said: “Keudell is probably not disposed
to give up his sinecure in Rome to him.” Bucher
replied: “Keudell really takes things too easy. We
thought he would send in a report on the Italian
expedition to the Red Sea, and he, in fact, promised one.
But what was it when it came? A description of the
ball recently given by him, how he danced a quadrille
with the Queen, how the knights of the Order of the
Annunziata danced <i lang="fr" title="face to face">vis-à-vis</i> to him, and other fine
and important matters of the kind, all in the fullest
detail. The Princess is to blame for this. The other
members of the family, including the Chief, have long
since been convinced of his incapacity. At the beginning,
during the first few months, I myself thought
there was something in him. He played the part of the
mysterious, reticent thinker, occasionally speaking very
well, and with far-reaching and brilliant ideas. But
one soon recognised that they were not his own, but
were borrowed from the Chief.”</p>

<p>The inhuman pair of us then rejoiced at England’s
misfortunes in the Soudan, and I expressed a hope that
Wolseley’s head would soon arrive in Cairo, nicely
pickled and packed. This led the conversation to
Central Asia. Bucher was of opinion that although the
Russians would not now occupy Herat, they would take
up such a position that at the next opportunity they
could annex it as they had done Merv. He then
referred to the intention of the English to disband the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>
native contingents of the Indian Princes, amounting in
all to 300,000 men and 1,200 field guns, and to the
“demonstrative review of the Rajah of Scinde.” I then
mentioned the rising of the blacks at Kitteh against
their English friends, and he said: “They are
threatened by a conflict with the French in Burmah.” In
reply to my question: “Have we given up South Africa,
or is the Lucia Bay affair still open?” he said that the
matter was still under consideration. (...)</p>

<p>At 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 30th of March a Chancery attendant
brought me the following pencil note from Bucher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“His Highness would like to have an article which
appeared in the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> of the 15th of January
(or a few days earlier) dealing with the question of the
different aspect things would assume if an English
Princess were Empress of Germany. Perhaps you have
this number?</p>

<p class="signature">
“Yours, <span class="smcap">Br.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately I had not kept the number, as I told
Bucher in a note which I sent back by the same messenger.
This doubtless explains the Chief’s recent
speech in answer to Richter’s allusion to the dynastic
connection between England and ourselves.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th of April paid Bucher
another visit. He wished me to draw a comparison
between the bellicose attitude of <cite>The Times</cite>, and that
which it observed previous to the outbreak of the
Crimean War, particulars of which were to be found in
Kinglake’s <cite>Invasion of the Crimea</cite>, Vol. <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, p. 31. He
believes that it is now inspired by Lord Dufferin.
There can be no question of war, as England has not
the necessary means at present, and Russia has for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>
moment no idea of seizing Herat, or even the mountain
line beyond it. In the Afghan campaign of 1839 the
English required for a force of 38,000 men no less than
100,000 camp followers and innumerable pack animals.
Nothing of this kind is now ready. It was said that
20,000 men passed in review before Abdurrahman and
Lord Dufferin at Rawal Pindi, but in reality they had
only 11,000 men there altogether. The commissariat
department was badly managed. Graham’s troops at
Suakim had only one pair of boots each, and when an
Irish regiment knelt down at mass one could see that
the soles were all torn and were patched with pieces of
the tin cans which had contained their preserved meats.
The soldiers they have at home are for the most part too
young to be employed in the tropics. The English
would require four months to get from Quetta to Herat.
The Russians could reach it much sooner. The ideas as
to the prospects of the two parties which Münster had
been hoaxed into believing were mere nonsense. Bucher
put all these facts together for the Prince, who submitted
them to the Emperor in the shape of a direct report.
“The Crown Prince’s people,” said Bucher, “are very
cross and very angry with the Chief because he will not
act as mediator in St. Petersburg and help England out
of her embarrassment, and because he opposes her
schemes at Constantinople. The English have offered
the Turks the occupation of Egypt in return for permission
to pass through the Dardanelles and the
Bosphorus. The Sultan was, however, informed from
Berlin and Vienna that we too had a word to say in the
matter, and our officers in Stamboul would take care
that the passage was stopped by torpedoes.”</p>

<p>On the 20th, Bucher sent me the third volume of
Kinglake’s book, and I wrote the article desired by him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span>
which appeared in No. 18 of <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, under the title
“Prospects of Peace and <cite>The Times</cite>.”</p>

<p>On the 22nd of April I called upon Secretary of
State von Thile, whom I had met on the way home a
few nights before, when I announced my visit. He was
very friendly and communicative, and we conversed
together from 11 to 1 o’clock. (...)</p>

<p>Thile gave me the following particulars of the agreement
with Russia in 1863: “Bismarck risked a great deal
thereby. We might have got ourselves into a war with
France, who would have begun by attacking us.
Napoleon was furious, because he had heard nothing
beforehand. Goltz wrote that he might be pacified if
the treaty were communicated to him. This was done.
Bismarck sent the treaty to Goltz, with instructions to
read it to the Emperor alone. Even the Ministers were
to know nothing of it. Napoleon was astounded at its
contents, and exclaimed, ‘Why, this is worse than I had
anticipated!’ It had no further consequences however.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 31st of May, I found in the <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite> of the 29th a leading article on the Emperor’s
indisposition, in which the alteration in the
policy of Prussia which would result from the approaching
change in the occupation of the throne was regarded
as full of hope for England. It was asserted among
other things that Prince Bismarck would no longer
exercise the influence which he now did upon the
Sovereign. I immediately called upon Bucher with the
paper, which I handed to him in order that he might
communicate the article to the Chief. He cast a glance
at the principal passages underlined by me, and promised
to cut out the article and send it to the Chancellor
without delay, mentioning at the same time that
I had brought it. He would doubtless deal with it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>
some way&mdash;probably get me to write an article on the
subject in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>. But he was going to leave
Berlin on Tuesday (the 2nd of June). Bucher went on
to say that it would really seem as if the Emperor were
not at all well just now. I asked him what was the
meaning of Lord Rosebery’s visit. He replied: “It is
in the main as the newspapers represent it. He has
been instructed to find out what the Chief’s views are
on various questions. No negotiations have taken place.
I was invited by the Prince to dine with them one day,
and the conversation turned on indifferent matters, such
as dogs, &amp;c. Rosebery said nothing on the main question,
namely, Afghanistan. It was the Chief who first
turned the conversation on to it.” I suggested: “But
the present understanding will doubtless be merely
provisional?” He: “I believe the matter will come
up again in about five years, when the railways are
finished. The Russians expect to have the line from
Kisil-Arwat to Askabad ready by 1886, and it will then
be carried on to Merv and to the Oxus in the direction
of Samarcand. The English are building their line
from the Indus to Candahar, by a détour <i lang="la" title="by way of">viâ</i> Pishin,
and not through the Bolan Pass, which is the shortest
route, but where it would run for twelve (German)
miles through defiles which the natives would be able to
block by simply rolling rocks down. But on the Pishin
route also they will meet with great difficulties, and will
not be ready for a long time.... Rosebery’s visit
was brought about by Herbert, who, by the way, has
not shown particular skill in the recent African negotiations.
He can be very offensive at times, which is
useful, but he has not sufficiently mastered these colonial
questions. He does not understand, for instance, that
colonies require a coast if they are to prosper, and so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>
made concessions which we are now trying to alter. He
allows himself to be won over too easily. Rosebery
had been particularly successful in that, and has quite
mesmerised him.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the Emperor once more, he said: “His
death will be a bad thing for us. Rottenburg believes
that the Chief will not retain office under the new
Emperor, and in that case it is not impossible that
Keudell may become Chancellor. He is in high favour
at the Crown Prince’s. They stay with him in Rome,
and people believe him far more capable than he really
is. He has provided for that in the press; as, for instance,
through Meding, at considerable cost to his own
or the Embassy funds.” (...)</p>

<p>At 12 o’clock (I had called on Bucher with the <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite> article at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>) a servant from the Chancellor’s
palace came to my lodgings to inquire whether I
could call upon the Prince at 3 o’clock. At a quarter
past 3 I was shown into the Chancellor’s study, and did
not leave until ten minutes past 4.</p>

<p>He was dressed in black with a military stock, and,
as usual, sat at his writing-table. He first quieted
Tiras, who sprang out and wanted to fly at me, shook
hands with his accustomed friendliness, and after I had
taken a seat opposite him, asked me how I was,
observing: “You still look exactly the same, not a bit
changed.” He mentioned that during the time he had
not seen me he had been overloaded with work. “Even
to-day I have been sitting here since 8 o’clock in the
morning,” he continued; “and it is the same from
week’s end to week’s end. The only break is at lunch
time, and, as you know, I also work then, reading
despatches and telegrams and giving instructions, &amp;c.
I must do almost everything myself. Hatzfeldt is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>
excellent ambassador, and he is also very good here at
receiving the diplomatists,&mdash;clever and intelligent, but
ailing and incapable of serious continuous work, impatient
of routine, and in addition to that he is frivolous
and has a poor memory. Busch is no longer of any use
either, and must get out of harness. Bojanowski is
ruined, and his Councillors are intriguing against him. My
son is not yet sufficiently trained, and has much to learn.”
I said: “But Busch was an excellent worker and knew
the business!” “Yes,” he replied, “but that is no
longer the case. The clock will no longer work. Latterly
he has been constantly unwell.... Herbert is getting
on very well in many things, but he must yet, as
the French say, <i lang="fr">faire ses caravanes</i>, or, as it is better
expressed in English, ‘sow his wild oats.’ <i lang="fr">Faire ses
caravanes</i>, you know, originally meant to join one of
the campaigns against the infidels, in which one had to
take part before becoming a knight of Malta. It therefore
signifies to get through one’s blundering as a
beginner and to grow wise by experience.”</p>

<p>He then took up the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> article which
Bucher had pasted on a sheet of paper and enclosed in a
letter, which also lay on the table. He said: “You
have sent me this. I thank you for it.”</p>

<p>I: “I thought it would interest you, particularly
one passage, as Bucher asked me a few weeks ago for a
leader of the same kind for you, as he knows I receive
the paper. I had not kept that number, but I afterwards
came across it elsewhere, and the article was translated
for the Emperor. I therefore thought you would be
glad to see this one immediately.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, and it is of interest. But it would
hardly do to write anything against or upon it just
now. It would have to be done very cautiously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>
and at the present moment in particular it would not
look at all well. The old gentleman is in a very
critical state, and you know it seems to me almost like
the case of a woman whose husband is dangerously ill,
and who talks to people about what she will do afterwards;
or, more correctly, as if my wife were dying and I
were to say how I should act after her death, and whether
I should marry again or not. We must wait until
the hour has come for a decision to be taken. It
appears that the Crown Prince wishes to retain me, but
I must carefully consider whether I ought to remain
with him. There are many arguments against it, and
many also in favour of it; but at present I am more
disposed to go and have no share in his experiments.
But I might look at it as Götz von Berlichingen did
when he joined the peasants&mdash;it will not be so bad; and
if I remain many things can be prevented or rendered
less harmful. But what if I were then not to have a
free hand?&mdash;to have colleagues like Forckenbeck and
George Bunsen, and ceaseless worries with them; while
latterly the old gentleman allowed me to do what I
thought proper, and even to select Ministers and replace
them by others? Besides, there is the co-regency of
the Crown Princess, who influences and completely
governs him. Yet what will the result be if I leave
them to themselves? The entire position of the Empire
depends upon the confidence which I have acquired
abroad. In France, for instance, where their attitude
is based exclusively upon the faith they place in my
word. The King of the Belgians said recently that a
written and signed contract would do less to put his
mind at ease than a verbal assurance from me that such
and such a course would be followed. It is the same
with Russia, where the Emperor trusts entirely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span>
me. I still remember at the Danzig meeting how he
conversed with me for a long time in his cabin and
listened to my opinion. The Emperor (William) was
not over pleased at his taking no notice of the parade
and the various celebrations; but he left us alone all the
same. And the Empress&mdash;the Danish Princess&mdash;said to
me: ‘Our whole confidence rests upon you. We know
that you tell the plain truth, and perform what you
promise.’... Of course I could retire and see how
they got on without me, and then when they called me
back after their experiment had failed, I could bring
things back into the old course. It would then have
been proved that affairs could not be conducted in that
way. He doubtless would not venture upon such
experiments if he had not got me in reserve. It was
just the same with the new era when the King gave
Liberalism a trial, because he had me to turn to eventually.
But I am an old man, over seventy, and for
twenty-nine years I have exhausted my strength in the
service of the State, and can no longer do what I once
did. I can no longer accompany the King wherever he
goes&mdash;on journeys, shooting parties and to watering
places. I can no longer ride to manœuvres and parades,
so as to prevent his being alone with others, and to take
immediate measures against the intrigues and influence
of opponents. If I were to persist in that sort of work
my illness would return, and I should soon be dead.”</p>

<p>He drew out from among the books on his right a
letter from Dr. Schweninger, who had written to him
that he had escaped a dangerous illness through regular
diet and the greatest possible abstinence from mental
exertion; but that if a recurrence of it were to be
averted he must continue to follow the same course. He
then said: “The Crown Princess is an Englishwoman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>
That is always the case with us. When our Princesses
marry abroad they doff the Prussian, and identify
themselves with their new country,&mdash;as for example the
Queen of Bavaria, who ultimately went so far as to
become a Catholic; and the lady in Darmstadt (it is
obvious that this was a slip of the tongue, and that he
meant Karlsruhe), as well as the consort of the Emperor
Nicholas. Here, however, they bring their nationality
with them, and retain it, preserving their foreign
interests.... Our policy must not necessarily be
anti-English, but if it were to be English it might prove
to be very much against our interest, as we have always
to reckon with the Continental Powers.” He further
observed that the Crown Prince would be influenced in
his liking for England by consideration for Queen
Victoria, and (here he mimicked the act of counting
money) her generosity. He has but a slight knowledge
of State affairs, and little interest in them, and
he lacks courage. I reminded the Chief that he, too,
had had to infuse courage into his father on the railway
journey from Jueterbogk to Berlin during the period of
conflict. He then related that incident once more, and
added: “He said that I should first come to the
scaffold&mdash;at that time I was called the Prussian Strafford;
but I replied: ‘What finer death could a man have
than to die for his King and his right?’”</p>

<p>He then came to speak of the Emperor’s illness, for
which&mdash;as he asserted&mdash;“the women were to blame,
with their desire to give themselves importance. He
was already ill, hoarse, when they talked him over into
driving with them to church. And then the Grand
Duchess wants to play the loving daughter before
people, and so she accompanies him when he, like
every one who works a great deal, would prefer to drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span>
out alone; and at the same time she argues with him,
even when the wind is in their faces, so that he catches
cold if he answers her. It was only his daughter’s
persuasion that induced him to go to Hatzfeldt’s dinner.
He ought not to have done that. (Probably according
to Lauer’s opinion.) As he sits at work, Augusta sticks
her head into the room and asks in a caressing voice,
‘Do I disturb you?’ When he, always gallant in his
treatment of ladies, and particularly of Princesses,
replies ‘No,’ she comes in and pours out all sorts of
insignificant gossip to him, and scarcely has she at last
gone away than she is back again knocking at the door
with her, ‘I am again disturbing you’; and so she again
wastes his time chattering. Now that he is ill&mdash;you
know what his complaint is&mdash;she is a real embarrassment
and plague to him. She sits there with him, and
when he wants to be left alone he does not venture to
tell her, so that in the end he gets quite red from pain
and restraint; and she notices it. That is not love,
however, but pure play-acting, conventional care and
affection. There is nothing natural about her&mdash;everything
is artificial, inwardly as well as outwardly.”</p>

<p>The conversation then turned upon Brunswick, and
I said: “Surely we shall soon have that now? It will
shortly be Prussian?” He replied in the negative,
saying: “It must remain independent, because without
the two votes of the Duchy the Federal Council
would no longer be of the slightest importance&mdash;Prussia
would always have a safe majority. The Brunswickers,
too, are anxious to retain their independence. In order
to maintain the present balance of voting power in the
Federal Council, I have always rejected the overtures
of the small fry such as Waldeck, &amp;c., that wanted to
be absorbed in Prussia. Things can be managed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>
they are, and we must give the larger States no reason
to mistrust us. <em>Their</em> confidence also is part of my
policy, and during recent years they have always
trusted me.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a while and looked at me. I rose
to go, and thanked him for this day’s invitation and
the confidence in me which it manifested, adding that
I was all the more pleased as I had been under the impression
that he had been angry with me for my last
book, and that I should not see him again. He clapped
me on the shoulder in a friendly way and said: “No,
Büschchen, everything remains as of old between us
two. It is true that you contributed to my illness with
your book, as it gave me a great deal of work.” I replied
that nothing of the kind should occur again, and gave
him my hand upon it.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 2nd of June, I went to Bucher to
tell him that I had been with the Chief, and to read
him my notes of the interview. He already knew that
I had been called to see him. In connection with what
I told him respecting the Chancellor’s resignation or
retention of office under the future Sovereign, he said:
“He has also given the French to understand ...
that possibly the next Emperor may not continue his
policy, so that in future it would be well for them in
Egyptian affairs to keep their demands and actions
within such limits as they thought they could, if left to
themselves alone, assert and maintain against the
English.” (...)</p>

<p>Bucher smiled at the apprehension which I now expressed
that the Chief had been offended at my book.
That, he said, was a mistake. With regard to the
Prince’s remark that it had given him a great deal of
work (he doubtless alluded chiefly to the revising of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>
proofs) Bucher observed: “Yes, I have had a good deal
to write on the subject to Reuss, for Andrassy complained
of various passages. But what he imagined he
had read was not in the book at all; he had read it
superficially, and we convinced him of that fact.”
Finally Bucher thanked me for the account of my interview
with the Chancellor, which he described as very
interesting.</p>

<p>During the first half of June I made an excursion
on foot from Dresden to North Bohemia, to Lausitz,
then back to Dresden, and from there to Moritzburg
and Meissen, in order to finally rid myself of a determination
of blood to the head which had seriously
troubled me all the winter. After my return to Berlin,
I called upon Bucher on the 16th June to ask him,
in the first place, what attitude should be adopted in
the press towards the new Ministry in England. I observed
that Gladstone had defended English interests
although in an unskilful and feeble way, and that
Salisbury would not suit our purposes any better,
indeed, perhaps less, because they would be more energetic.
He replied that Salisbury is blunt in manner,
as he had himself experienced when he was in Berlin.
He might, however, for the moment be more welcome
to the Chief than Gladstone, who had been seeking a
<i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> with Russia in favour of which there
seemed to be a party in that country. Salisbury, on
the other hand, had spoken too strongly against Russia
to leave much prospect of an understanding at the
present time between the Tories and St. Petersburg.
True, one could not say what might happen in this
respect later on, and the new English Ministry would
also seek an understanding with France.</p>

<p>He then mentioned Count Herbert’s second mission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>
to London, which had not turned out so well as the
first one respecting Angra Pequena and the Fiji Islands,
in which he had taken up a very strong position with
good results. The second mission should have appeared,
as far as the public was concerned, merely a visit to
Rosebery, with whom Herbert stayed. Its object,
however, was to negotiate respecting Lucia Bay and the
Benue district; and Herbert, who was not sufficiently
well acquainted with the maps, &amp;c., conceded too
much to Rosebery, who was very sharp, so that the
result was disadvantageous to us. We lost Lucia Bay.
The English Minister argued that they could not
abandon it to us, as it was impossible to allow the Cape
Colony to be hemmed in on both sides. On the Benue,
however, they have annexed a large piece of land, well
situated for their purposes.</p>

<p>Bucher then complained of the “gross ineptitude”
displayed by Gerhard Rohlfs in his mission to Zanzibar.
“He got it,” he said, “through the ‘paidocracy,’ as
Busch calls it,&mdash;through the influence of the Chancellor’s
sons upon their father, and he has spoilt everything.
Contrary to the regulations, which require an examination
to be passed first, he was appointed Consul-General
without any examination, although he is not particularly
well informed.... The trap had been very cleverly
prepared for Sultan Burgasch. He has a sister who is
married to a German, a Hamburg merchant named Reute,
and lives now in Germany. Burgasch had robbed her
of her inheritance, and this was to be the starting
point of the scheme. She was to go out to Zanzibar and
press her claim, and an accident might possibly occur
to the lady,&mdash;her brother might have her strangled. In
the meantime Rohlfs was also to go out, quite quietly,
by way of the Red Sea, and not on board a man-of-war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>
He, however, induced the Chief to let him travel <i lang="la" title="by way of">viâ</i>
London and the Cape; and at Cape Town he talked
imprudently about his mission and position to some
officers of Warren’s expedition (to Bechuanaland), so that
the English got wind of the matter, and were able to
take their measures accordingly (this was under Gladstone’s
Government, through their Consul, Kirk). And
in Zanzibar itself he committed one blunder after another.
When this came to the knowledge of the Chief he said
in his own family circle that he would recall him. Paul
Lindau, who constantly haunts the Chancellerie, got it
into the newspapers, whereupon a <i lang="fr" title="denial">démenti</i> was issued.
Later on, however, the Prince returned to his former
intention, as Rohlfs proved quite useless.”... Bucher
further related that Herbert had “provided himself with
a deputy Under-Secretary of State in the person of
Darenthall, who was to act for himself when he was
absent. Darenthall is an admirer of Keudell, with whom
he spent nine years in Rome, where there is nothing to
do, as everything is sent there ready prepared. He
cannot have gained much experience of the world there,
while others sent to various posts became acquainted
with different countries and conditions of life. He did
not, however, turn out badly as Consul-General in Egypt.
When he comes to the office I shall take a long leave of
absence in order not to lose the last trace of my self-respect....
Bill, who will shortly get married and
who is going to Hanau, has also picked out a successor,
von Rheinbaben. It is true that he belongs to the old
nobility, but he is quite incapable,”&mdash;a statement in
support of which Bucher produced sundry evidence.
Finally we rejoiced that the Emperor was quite well
again, and Bucher added: “Yes, and in very good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>
humour, as may be seen from the remarks which he
makes on the matters submitted to him.” (...)</p>

<p>On the 16th of October Bucher called at my lodgings
to inform me that on Hatzfeldt’s departure as Ambassador
for London, Herbert Bismarck is to be appointed
Secretary of State, and that the latter has
selected Holstein as Under-Secretary. The Chief had
some one else in view, apparently Berghen, but Herbert
would probably be able to carry out his views with
regard to Holstein. He had already made up the
differences between the latter and the Princess. In
these circumstances he, Bucher, meant to retire. He
had already asked the Prince on several occasions to
arrange for his retirement on the score of ill-health.
Although the Chief had, through Herbert, declined to do
this, and only granted him a six months’ leave of
absence, he would probably on the conclusion of that
period renew his request. He intends to leave on
the 1st of November, and to spend his holiday on the
Lake of Geneva. On parting he said: “Adieu! I must
now return to the treadmill.”</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, on the morning of the 5th of January, 1886,
I handed in at the Imperial Chancellor’s residence in the
Wilhelmstrasse a letter offering, as usual, my services<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span>
and requesting an interview. Having received a favourable
reply, I was at the palace punctually at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and
was at once shown in to the Prince. He shook hands
saying: “How do you do, Büschlein?” I sat down at
the writing-table opposite to him. On my remarking
that he looked exceptionally well, he complained of the
continuance of his faceache, which did not arise from a
bad tooth, as I had supposed, and for which Schweninger
could do nothing. His cure had only prevented him
from getting stouter and relieved his biliousness. He
then said: “There is nothing going on in politics just
now.”</p>

<p>I: “One sees that from the newspapers. You take
care that they shall have nothing of importance to
write about. You have again preserved the peace
for us.”</p>

<p>He: “In Bulgaria, where the Austrian policy was inconceivably
bad. It was as if they had no agents whatever
there, no one to observe and report. They were
of opinion that the Rumelian business was instigated by
the Russians and in their interest, and so they thought
‘If you let your Bulgarians loose we will march out
our Servians.’ They obviously promised the latter
more than they could perform, and when the war went
against Milan made enemies of both sides. Khevenhüller
acted too roughly. He threatened the Prince
that if he did not call a halt within twenty-four hours
the Austrians would march against him. And the
Servians were also obliged to stop and their action
crippled. Now the Bulgarians complain, ‘If you had
not crossed our path we should be in Belgrade by this
time,’ and the Servians, on the other hand, assert that
if they had not been ordered to keep the peace they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span>
would have renewed the struggle with fresh forces, and
wiped out their defeat. The policy which they are
carrying on in Vienna is that of the father confessor
and the banker. The Länderbank, which advanced the
Servians the money for the war, is acting like the Caisse
d’Escompte in Paris, and exercises similar influence.
It is as if Cohn, the banker at Dresden, wanted to
influence our policy. They ought to know in Vienna
that the events in Rumelia are the result of English
wire-pulling, and that it is England who supports the
Prince. He has been on bad terms with the Emperor
Alexander for years past. He is a man of intelligence,
but false and untrustworthy, and that is known in St.
Petersburg. At the present moment the Battenberger
is the main hindrance in the way of a satisfactory
settlement of the Bulgarian question. The Emperor
does not trust him even after his recent praise of the
Russian officers. Order must be re-established from the
outside, through an occupation by foreign troops&mdash;but
who is to supply them? It would not do for the
Russians to undertake the job, and just as little for the
Austrians.”</p>

<p>I: “Might I ask what is your opinion of the
character of the Emperor Alexander?”</p>

<p>He: “He is better than his reputation in our
newspapers, more sensible, a simpler nature, and above
all more honourable. Quite different to his father,
more manly, and neither imaginative nor sentimental.
He is a respectable father of a family, has no <i lang="fr">liaisons</i>
and makes no debts. Having nothing to conceal, it is
not necessary for him to trouble his head with vain
imaginings and tricky deceptions. But he is subject to
ecclesiastical influences.”</p>

<p>I: “Pobedonoszeff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span></p>

<p>He: “Yes, and others.” He then related: “He
was in Copenhagen during the complications with the
English respecting Afghanistan, and Giers telegraphed
to him repeatedly begging him to return. He remained,
however, saying, ‘Giers has his hands full (hat die
Hosen voll) but he must see for himself how he is going
to put the matter straight.’”</p>

<p>I: “He has been described to me as stupid, exceedingly
stupid; but that was from a Baltic source.”</p>

<p>He: “In a general way that is saying too much,
but of course allowance must be made for the inhabitants
of the Baltic Provinces. Poor people! But we cannot
help them. History furnishes many instances in which
Divine Providence has permitted such nobler communities
and peoples to be swallowed up by a larger but
less noble nation. In this case it is unwise on the part
of the Government, and it does more harm to Russia
than to us, when they allow such a breeding establishment
for good generals, like Todtleben, and for capable
diplomatists as they possess in the nobility of the Baltic
Provinces to be ruined. They have in view the unity
of the Empire and not without reason, as is shown in
the case of the Poles, but that they should carry it so
far and go to work in such a crude way, and in particular
that they should incite the populace against the upper
classes! I have often wondered why more of them do
not sell out and emigrate. But this oppression is more
damaging to the Russians than to us, and, moreover,
the Baltic Germans never formed part of the German
Empire, although they have always been closely
associated with the popular life of Germany.”</p>

<p>I asked: “Might I inquire on what footing your
Serene Highness now stands with the Crown Prince?
You have recently been dining with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span></p>

<p>He: “Oh, quite satisfactory, and for several months
past, as also with <em>her</em>. When the Emperor seemed to
be drawing near his latter end, he approached me, as he
saw that the time was at hand when he must plunge
into the water and swim on his own account. Ever
since we have been on good terms. He wishes to retain
me, and when he commands as King I must remain,
although I am ill and require rest&mdash;but we must come
to an understanding first. The main point for him is
to get some one to conduct the foreign policy. Domestic
affairs would go on all right under Bötticher, who
manages them quite well, except that he is rather too
vehement, so that water must sometimes be poured into
his wine.” He then spoke against the “collegial
system”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and in favour of a homogeneous administration.</p>

<p>I mentioned the Emperor and the jubilee of his
reign, observing that a good text for a sermon on that
occasion would be found in Ecclesiasticus, where it is
said “The work praiseth the master, and his hands do
honour to a wise prince”; and in particular the further
passage “the prosperity of a ruler resteth with God;
he giveth him a worthy Chancellor;” and again, “A
wise servant shall be ministered unto by his master, and
a master that hath understanding murmureth not thereat.”
(I had already directed attention to these passages<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> of the 31st of December of the previous
year.) He smiled; after remarking that the Emperor
had acted conscientiously in State affairs and knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span>
how to subordinate his <i lang="fr">amour propre</i> to the interests of
the country, he said: “He always gave me to a great
extent a free hand, although he had been accustomed
previously to command, while his brother, on the other
hand, could never have got on with any independent
Minister.”</p>

<p>I then referred to the Irish crisis and the English
parties, observing that there one saw plainly what
Parliamentarism resulted in, and whither it led a State.
Our Liberals would have had a similar experience in
Posen and in Polish affairs generally, but, happily, they
had not the same influence here as they have in England.
He said: “Parliamentarism only works where there are
merely two rival parties that come to power alternately,
and where the members of the Legislature are well off
and unselfish, and do not find it necessary to struggle
for their personal advancement. I am no advocate of
absolutism. Parliamentarism is good even here, as a
veto upon the resolutions of unwise Governments and
bad monarchs&mdash;for purposes of criticism. In England,
up to the present, there have been two great parties,
whose principles have latterly not differed very widely,
and both desired the welfare of the country and nothing
for themselves. They were the representatives of a few
hundred families who were well enough off not to want
more, and who could therefore study exclusively the
welfare of the whole community&mdash;a remark which at
bottom also applies to Kings, who should be under no
necessity to think of their own interests. The Irish are
now coming in as a third party, together with the
Radicals, who are still more dangerous. It is worse
here in Germany. We have eight or ten parties and
the leaders are place hunters, who want to improve
their own positions and become Ministers, and who also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>
put themselves at the service of the capitalists&mdash;not
without a consideration.”</p>

<p>He then spoke about the Kulturkampf, and
mentioned that the Pope was now thoroughly well
disposed. I said: “Of course you have done him a
great pleasure in asking for his mediation in the
difference with Spain, and given him an importance
for which he has every reason to be grateful.” He
smiled and said: “Well, he has invested me with his
highest Order, and has at the same time written me a
very flattering letter.” We then spoke of other
Orders and I asked him how many he had now. In
1872 he had, I believed, already sixty-four.</p>

<p>He: “There can hardly have been so many. Since
then, however, the Siamese and other Asiatics have
added theirs.”</p>

<p>I: “Japan was also included with the two great
razors, the case containing the swords with which you
were raised to the rank of Daimio.”</p>

<p>He: “Even the Emperor of China has made me a
present, a great elephant tusk with carved figures,
flowers, houses and birds, all so deeply cut out that you
almost see through the carving. It is believed that the
carving took eight years. You ought to have a look at
it some time. It stands in the corner on the black
chimney piece in the second room upstairs, near the
large <i lang="fr">salon</i>.” He rang the bell and instructed the servant
to show me upstairs when I was leaving.</p>

<p>“Why have we not been able to secure the Santa
Lucia Bay?” I asked. “Ah!” he replied, “it is
not so valuable as it seemed to be at first. People who
were pursuing their own interests on the spot represented
it to be of greater importance than it really was.
And then the Boers were not disposed to take any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>
proper action in the matter. The bay would have
been valuable to us if the distance from the Transvaal
were not so great. And the English attached so much
importance to it that they declared it was impossible
for them to give it up, and they ultimately conceded a
great deal to us in New Guinea and Zanzibar. In
colonial matters we must not take too much in hand at
a time, and we already have enough for a beginning. We
must now hold rather with the English, while, as you
know, we were formerly more on the French side. But,
as the last elections in France show, every one of any importance
there had to make a show of hostility to us.”</p>

<p>I inquired as to the spirit monopoly, and he replied:
“They will scarcely pass it, but we shall introduce it.
They will look upon us as people who have evil intentions
against the country, and in particular against
themselves, their rights and powers, and who must,
therefore, be kept in check and taught to entertain
proper respect towards the representatives of the people,
to which category, of course, we do not belong. But
after all we are only fulfilling the duties of our office,
part of which is to promote the interests of the State to
the best of our ability.”</p>

<p>On my saying, “Well, Münster is now in Paris,” he observed:
“A change has taken place in him. He is now
less phlegmatic, more diligent, and sends fuller reports,
which, moreover, have something in them.” (...)</p>

<p>“Bucher is also away,” I observed, “on a long leave
of absence, for the present.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, because he has begged me, I should say
ten times, to allow him to retire on account of his
health. I have at length given him leave for six
months on full pay. He was an excellent book of reference
for all occasions, as his good memory had enabled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>
him to read and collect a great deal of information. In
addition to that he is a good and worthy man”&mdash;a
statement in which I heartily concurred.</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly 4 o’clock, and on his
pausing for a moment I rose to go. Before leaving I
begged him to let me know when he thought I could be
of any active use in the press, and he promised to do
this. The servant then showed me upstairs through the
large <i lang="fr">salon</i> (in which a Christmas tree was still standing,
as well as a table covered with presents), and from this
into a room opening on the garden. Here were large
full length portraits in oils of the Emperor William, in
ermine robes, and the Emperors of Austria and Russia,
an oil painting of the proclamation of the German
Empire at Versailles (at that time only the frame, the
picture having been removed to be varnished), and on
the black chimney piece the Chinese elephant tusk,
almost two metres in length. In another room I saw
an excellent new portrait of the Chancellor (painted by
Angeli, according to the servant), and, leaning against
a sofa, a half length portrait of Pope Leo XIII., by
Lenbach. (...)</p>

<p><i>May 29th.</i>&mdash;I called on Bucher ... who told
me he had received the Emperor’s order placing him on
the retired list, together with the instructions of the
Imperial Chancellor, by which it was accompanied. In conclusion
the Chancellor thanked him for his long service,
and added “hearty” good wishes for his future....</p>

<p>We remained good friends, and Bucher frequently
joined Hehn and myself at our Wednesday evening
meetings at Trarbach’s. I visited him repeatedly in
the autumn and winter of 1886 and in January, 1887,
on his return from the visit to Stirum. On the 13th of
January I took him the payment for an article which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>
had written for the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> and which was published
in No. 41 of that paper, on “Two Diminishers of the
Realm.” (These were Gladstone and Windthorst, the
comparison having been drawn at the suggestion of
Bismarck.) On this occasion Bucher told me that he
prepared the draft of the Constitution of the North
German Confederation. At that time (after the return
from Nikolsburg in the autumn of 1866) Bismarck lay
seriously ill at Putbus. Savigny, who as Secretary of
State should have attended to the matter, took Keudell
into his counsels and they thought the thing could be
done by introducing a few alterations into the old Constitution
of the German Bund. Bucher had to draft
the preamble for it. On his return he was summoned
to the Chief, who declared Savigny’s performance to be
worthless, and dictated to him, Bucher, with the assistance
of “a little book,” probably Pölitz’s work on the
various Constitutions, the main lines of a Constitution
for the new Federal State, which he then wrote out with
the help of a clerk, and&mdash;when the latter was unable to
write any longer&mdash;in his own hand. He began work in
the afternoon and went on with it all night through and
until next morning. After the Chief had made a few
alterations he immediately had twelve copies of the
Constitution written out in the Foreign Office. Bucher
also gave me some particulars of Keudell’s stupidity.
When he was going to Rome the Chief, for his personal
information, explained to him his views about Italy,
saying that we should not tolerate a move towards
France. Keudell thought he should mention this to
Visconti-Venosta, and did so. The Chief disapproved,
and instructed him to take the first opportunity of
stating to the Italian Minister that what he had said
was merely the expression of his personal views. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span>
has, however, omitted to report whether he had carried
out these instructions.</p>

<p>On the 15th I wrote to the Prince asking for an
appointment, and in accordance with the reply, called at
the palace in the Wilhelmstrasse on the 27th of January,
1887. While I was waiting, first Rottenburg and then
three little Rantzaus with their nurserymaid passed
through the antechamber. (...) At 2.15 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Theiss
called me in to the Prince. He came towards me,
reached out his hand and asked how I was. I replied:
“Well, and as one sees from the newspapers it is the
same with yourself.”</p>

<p>He: “Not during the last few days. I have an
oppression and pains here (he passed his hand over his
chest), I fancy something like inflammation of the
lungs”&mdash;a statement which was open to grave doubt, as
he looked quite healthy and rosy.</p>

<p>When Tiras had been driven away and I had taken
a seat opposite him at the writing-table, he asked:
“Now then, what have you been doing in the press
recently?”</p>

<p>I replied: “A variety of things in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
on the situation. But you yourself have said the last
word on the subject in the Reichstag, fully and convincingly&mdash;for
sensible people. But I fear it will not
last long. The stupid people will not die out in the
land, and no sooner have you enlightened them, than
somebody will take pains to put the light out again.
The clerical press continues to pile up misrepresentations
and lies, and the large and small sheets of the Progressist
party do the same to the best of their ability;
while the judicial luminaries of the provinces help to
stir up discontent.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, and all the pettifogging attorneys. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span>
fancy, too, from the credulity of the public there
is little improvement to be hoped for from the new
elections.”</p>

<p>I: “It is a pity that the representatives of the
people, as they call themselves&mdash;the representatives of
the cliques&mdash;were not excluded by the Constitution
from all interference in military and foreign affairs. It
should only have been allowed in exceptional cases, and
on the special invitation of the Government. Such a
provision had been unfortunately omitted from the
North German Constitution.” He said that was not
quite the case, but it was true that at that time mistakes
had been made, as he was ill at the beginning, and the
“Ministry of War,” which was jealous of the “Military
Cabinet,” introduced various unpractical provisions. He
then explained to me the present legal position, much
as he had already done in the Reichstag, reading and
commenting upon the paragraphs in the Constitution
which affected this question, beginning with § 60. He
concluded with the words: “Things may again develop
into a conflict, if the three Powers which have equal
authority cannot come to an understanding in the hour
of danger. Our first and greatest necessity is a strong
and steadfast army, as that secures our external freedom,
our existence, our possessions against the foes that
threaten us from without. Of course we could defend
these without the present Constitution, and could certainly
do so more successfully without a Reichstag like
the last one, which was much less an expression
of our unity than of our divisions and Particularism
and which was little else than a hindrance
in the defence of our most important interests.
I could immediately secure the sanction of the Emperor
to a change in this respect, and that of the Federal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>
Governments also. But that must wait yet awhile&mdash;until
we see how these and perhaps the next elections turn
out. If no better Reichstag is elected, when the compromise,
<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, the septennate, has run out, the first thing
will be to put into force the provision which allows the
Emperor to call out contingents proportionate to the
population, the only restriction arising from financial
considerations. He has always the right to raise as many
soldiers as he considers necessary, and of course the
expense thus incurred must be voted.&mdash;But what I
wanted to say to you is this. I have used reassuring
language in the Reichstag with regard to the present
attitude of Russia towards us. But many considerations
had to be passed over in silence to which it would not
have served my purpose to give utterance, but which
may be indicated in the press&mdash;cautiously. There, I was
speaking not only to the members of the Reichstag and
the German public, but also to foreign countries, and to
a particular quarter where I wished to let it be seen
that I trusted to their insight, good will and love of
peace, and where such confidence is appreciated&mdash;the
Emperor Alexander&mdash;especially when it comes from a
quarter in which he himself may and really does repose
unlimited confidence. That is quite true. The Emperor
and Giers now anticipate no danger for Russia from
Germany, and consequently do not think of attacking
us; and so far as the immediate future is concerned they
will in all probability not adopt a hostile attitude
towards us, if things remain as they now are in Germany
and Russia. At the same time a change may occur in
the situation. There is, in addition to the Emperor, a
kind of public opinion, parties that must be reckoned
with even now, and which in a war between Germany
and France would exercise all the greater influence on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
the decisions of the Crown, in that their views and
demands would appear to coincide with the real interests
of Russia. There you have the pan-Slavists, with their
hatred of the Germans and their leaning towards France.
And then there are the Poles and the Liberal Russians, who
desire a war with us in the hope that it would result in the
defeat of Russia and secure their ultimate aim, namely,
independence for the Poles and a Constitution for the
others. In case of a conflict between Germany and
France, these parties would exert a stronger pressure in
exalted regions than they have ever been able to do up
to the present, through their newspapers, and their
allies in the army, in the Ministries, and in Court
circles. Even the possibility of their efforts ultimately
affecting the judgment and love of peace prevailing
there&mdash;as did actually occur under the late Emperor,
before the last Russo-Turkish war&mdash;would force us to
send an army of observation of at least 100,000 men to
our eastern frontier to watch the 200,000 soldiers
stationed by Russia in her western provinces, thus considerably
weakening our available forces against France.
Moreover, supposing that, in spite of this, we were
victorious, public opinion in St. Petersburg and Moscow,
and ultimately the Government under its pressure, would
scarcely suffer us to turn our victory to sufficiently good
account in order to thoroughly weaken France for the next
thirty or forty years, as that would be a strengthening
of the German Empire which might arouse serious
apprehension in Russia. Finally, it may be regarded as
well-nigh certain that while we were engaged in the
west the Russians would attack Austria, as her armaments,
even more than ours, require strengthening&mdash;a duty
which she has hitherto with culpable levity neglected&mdash;and
in the long run we should doubtless be obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
come to her assistance. Of course I could not say all
that, and even in the press it must be very cautiously
dealt with.”</p>

<p>I observed: “I do not know whether I am right,
but I fear a war with Russia less from any apprehension
of defeat, than because, in case of victory, I do not see
what we could take to compensate us for the great
sacrifices incurred.”</p>

<p>He: “Certainly, and for the great number of troops
we should lose. That keeps me from a war with France
also. In that case, too, it is a question of ‘Was
kannst Du, armer Teufel, geben?’ (Thou, poor devil,
what canst thou give?)”</p>

<p>I: “In the long run the milliards were also no
blessing, at least not for our manufacturers, as they led
to over-production. It was merely the bankers who
benefited, and of these only the big ones.” From this
we came to speak of the Stock Exchange and the
present fall of prices, whereupon he remarked:
“Bleichröder told me recently that he too has mobilised
his forces, and at the right moment, some time
ago.”</p>

<p>I mentioned having read in the <cite lang="de">Boersenzeitung</cite> that,
according to a small South German newspaper, the
Emperor had been much incensed at the rejection of the
Army Bill, and had spoken in the presence of Bismarck
and the Crown Prince of a step which, if carried into
effect, would have aroused the deepest regret. People
thought that this referred to his abdication. But who
could have circulated and made public the account of
such an incident? He said: “The only element of
truth in the story is that he was very angry with the
Opposition. There was no question of abdicating.
But he might very well be induced to agree to a step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span>
which would put an end to all the difficulties that the
Reichstag can raise in military matters.” He then spoke
once more of the Opposition parties, and their mendacity
and fictions; as that he (Bismarck) wants to abolish or
to restrict universal suffrage, and with the assistance of
an accommodating Parliament, to introduce tobacco and
spirit monopolies, and what not besides, even to the
revival of serfdom. “That is only credited by the stupid
voters. They themselves, Richter and his apostles, do
not for a moment imagine that anything of the kind is
intended. It is a mere electioneering dodge of a gross
and audacious description, according to Goethe’s recipe:
‘<i lang="de" title="If you want to cheat on her, just don't do it nicely">Willst Du sie betrügen, so mach es nur nicht fein</i>.’
And it is the same with that lying rascal Windthorst,
and his priestly followers. At one moment liberty is
threatened, and then the Church, and all this merely to
hide the fact that he will not let the Empire have peace,
and wants to pave the way for the return of the Guelphs
to Hanover. The whole crowd are hypocrites, and wear
masks, and in all this Parliamentary mummery I am the
only one who shows his face. They are Particularists
one and all, in spite of their professions. The German
Liberals are Particularists for their party, and the others
are territorial Particularists. They are all striving for
disintegration and dissolution. But when all is said
and done, a Prussian King of to-day can, if they don’t
want him, renounce the Empire and exist for himself
alone.”</p>

<p>I asked: “How do you stand with the old gentleman
at present?”</p>

<p>He: “With the Pope? Excellently, and in this
question, too. He also trusts me and has reason to
believe in my fair play. I told him I was prepared to
go still further, meaning that I should even be pleased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>
see a Papal Nuncio in Berlin. But the King will not
have it. He thinks in that case he would have to become
a Catholic in his old age. The Ministers are also against
it, but without reason. I am not afraid of it. On the
contrary, things would go better. At present, Windthorst
is the Nuncio, the Father of Lies. We know now
exactly how he carries on with Rome. We have letters
of his in our hands. A real Nuncio could not lie in that
fashion to us and to the Pope, who is well disposed and
reasonable. He would be an ecclesiastical diplomatist,
whose aims would be purely ecclesiastical, and who would
not wish to lose credit with the Government and render
himself impossible. He would have to carry out the
instructions of his superiors in Rome&mdash;not at Gmunden&mdash;and
those instructions would be imbued with a peace-loving
spirit and would be favourable to the maintenance
of the Empire&mdash;as may now be seen from the desire expressed
by the Pope that the Centre party should vote
for the Army Bill.”</p>

<p>I: “What I was really thinking of was the Emperor
and your relations to him.”</p>

<p>He: “I have also been on the best of terms with
him for a long time past. Apart from the question of
the Nunciature we are in perfect agreement upon all
points. The Crown Prince, too, is at present everything
I could wish him to be, <em>she</em> is likewise thoroughly well disposed
towards me.”</p>

<p>I: “Mr. Gladstone’s admirer? Why, that is most
satisfactory.”</p>

<p>He: “They are now quite reasonable. They have no
intention of introducing any change when the old gentleman
goes, and they have repeatedly told me so. They are
still afraid that I may not remain. And really I often
wish it were otherwise, as I would rather go and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>
spend my last days at Friedrichsruh, as a mere
spectator.”</p>

<p>I: “And have Dr. Busch to arrange your papers, as
your Serene Highness suggested three years ago.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, that too. But I must remain as long as a
Prussian King wants my services and wishes to retain me.”</p>

<p>I: “And after all you would not like to desert your
work and let it fall into the hands of people like Virchow
and Forckenbeck. You once spoke to me about Götz von
Berlichingen and Metzler, the ringleader of the peasants.”</p>

<p>He: “That by remaining I could at least prevent
the worst from happening. Such an eventuality is no
longer to be apprehended. People deceive themselves
greatly if they imagine there will be any considerable
difference under the new King. But my position is
difficult enough now that I no longer have the strength
to work continuously at all manner of things, although
there is always so much to be done. All the Ministers
come to consult me upon subjects which, properly speaking,
do not concern me, and make me responsible for
them. That is the case even with the Ministry of the
Household, where Schleinitz, the lazy fellow, neglected
everything, and Stolberg is often away. But one must
do his duty. As to what you say about my work, it
looks great, but after all it is of the earth and transient.
Besides, what is the meaning of ‘great?’ Germany is
great, but the earth is greater, and how small the earth
is in comparison with the solar system, to say nothing
of the whole universe. And how long will it last?”</p>

<p>I: “Hegel maintained that the earth was the sole
planet with intellectual life, thought and history.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, because it was upon the earth he philosophised.
Certainly there are worlds where things of
much greater importance are thought and done. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>
that is the way of these professors (he mentioned
Virchow, Du Bois Reymond, and then asked what was
the name of the third natural philosopher&mdash;I suggested
‘Helmholtz’), they speak as if they knew everything;
while they undoubtedly know a great deal in
their own science, even there they are ignorant of the
real root of things, to say nothing of other matters.
They go as far as the cell, but what causes the cell?”</p>

<p>I: “I picture the world to myself as a point, that
may be termed the first cause of God, which then extends
itself to a ball, filling the void.”</p>

<p>He: “And yet permits it to exist for ever.” I rose
to take leave. He gave me his hand and said: “I am
glad to see you look so well and not in the least
changed. And such a lot of hair still. Let me see.”
I bent down in order that he might see the crown of
my head, and he said: “Yes, it’s your own. I thought
you wore a wig. But the beard is growing white. You
should get it cut off and have your moustache dyed.
Then you would be quite young.”</p>

<p>The most important part of this interview, which
finished at 3 o’clock, was worked up into the article,
“War Clouds in the West,” which appeared in No. 6
of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, and was forwarded to the Prince.</p>

<p><i>March 25th.</i>&mdash;For about a week past various newspapers
have published a statement to the effect that
Keudell has tendered his resignation on the ground that
the alliance between Germany and Italy which was
concluded a short time since was not drawn up through
him but through the Italian Ambassador in Berlin. A
diplomatic negotiation of the highest importance had
therefore been carried on over his head, and he had been
merely instructed quite at the end to hand over to
Robilant the reward for his good offices in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>
shape of the Black Eagle. In other words, Bismarck
had looked upon him as fit only to fulfil representative
functions of a formal order, and had acted accordingly.
At last! How often does the pitcher go to the well
before it is broken, said I to myself, as I read a <i lang="fr" title="denial">démenti</i>
in the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>. So not yet awhile? (...)</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 28th of April one of the Chancery
attendants brought me the following note: “The
Imperial Chancellor would feel obliged if Dr. Busch
would do him the honour to call upon him to-day at
2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Berlin, April 28th, 1887.” (No signature.)
I went at the hour appointed and was told by the
porter that Rottenburg wished to see me first. The
latter said that the Prince had two commissions for
me: one a description of the League of Patriots, and
the other an article on the Hammerstein motion
(respecting the Evangelical Church). At 3 o’clock
Theiss showed me into the Prince, with whom I remained
until 3.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> He again complained a great
deal about his ailments and insomnia, as well as of
being overburdened with work by all the Ministries.
“Nevertheless,” I remarked, “on your last birthday
you outlived the year in which you prophesied you
were to die,” and I reminded him of what he had said
at Versailles and at Varzin, adding that I now took
the liberty for the first time of congratulating him on
his birthday, because the last one marked an important
division of his life. He smiled and said: “Yes, a
division. I had observed that there were certain
divisions in my life, with changes and alterations
physical and mental, a certain recurrent cycle of years
(I believe he said eleven) and from that and some
cabalistic figures I had reckoned that I should reach
the age of seventy-one years and die in 1886. As that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>
has not happened I shall now probably live to the age
of eighty-three or eighty-four.” He then came to
speak of the subject which had led him to send for me.
It appeared that he was not thinking so much of
Hammerstein and Co., as of the embarrassment of the
Ultramontanes in dealing with their “priestocracy,” the
demagogues of the middle and lower clergy, whom they
had summoned to their assistance against the Government,
and who had now cast off discipline and were
disinclined to follow the Pope’s instructions. He compared
their embarrassment to that of the wizard’s
apprentice in Goethe, and spoke of the “Anti-Papal
Catholics.” He concluded: “I should not like to
have that said in one of our papers. We still want
the Centre party for the sugar and spirit taxes.”</p>

<p>I then mentioned the League of Patriots, and afterwards
turned the conversation on to Alsace-Lorraine.
On my observing that it might, perhaps, be possible to
annex it to Prussia, or divide it between Bavaria and
Baden, he replied: “To unite it to Prussia would
strengthen by thirty votes the Opposition in the Lower
House of the Prussian Diet, where things are now very
tolerable. The Bavarians will not hear of it either, and
still less the people in Baden, who are in absolute terror
of such a change. If we were only living in the time of
Charlemagne we could remove the Alsacians to Posen,
and place the inhabitants of the latter country between
the Rhine and the Vosges, or form an uninhabited
desert between ourselves and the French. As it is,
however, we must try some other method.” We then
spoke about the Crown Prince, who, he said, was understood
to have a polypus in the throat. It would be no
wonder if he did not recover, as “she” never allowed
him to have more than eleven degrees (Réaumur) of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span>
warmth in his room, and obliged him at Ems to go into
the cold and windy mountain districts, and to cross the
Rhine in storm and rain, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I said: “It appears that Diest-Daber wishes to
proceed with his action once more.”</p>

<p>He: “But how can he do that?” He then gave me
an account of the affair, which originated in an action
against Diest for libel. This was afterwards transformed
by Klotz into a prosecution against him, Bismarck,
which resulted in his vindication. He concluded:
“Diest is suffering from the mania of persecution, that
is to say, in its active form&mdash;he must persecute somebody.
It would now seem to have turned into
megalomania.” On our coming to speak of his fortune,
I said: “To show what superstitions prevail on this
subject, a tradesman, who is otherwise a sensible man,
told me recently that you possess a fortune of at least a
hundred millions.” He thereupon gave me a detailed
account of his circumstances, and spoke of the value of
his various estates, adding that he was not thinking&mdash;“as
his sons wished him to do”&mdash;of increasing his capital,
but rather of rounding off and improving his property.
He mentioned Chorow and Sedlitz, and the purchases of
land in the Sachsenwald, and similar matters. “I
cannot help it,” he said. “When a neighbour’s property
wedges itself into mine, and I see a fine clump of
trees on it that are going to be cut down, I must buy
that piece of ground.” In making such purchases he
often paid too much, and frequently the estates were
not well managed by those to whom they were entrusted.
Thus, although in good years, when high
prices were to be had for timber, &amp;c., his profits might
amount to about 100,000 thalers, he had, on several occasions,
had no surplus whatever over his expenses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span>
“Moreover,” he continued, “it costs me more to live in
the country than in Berlin; and in Varzin my horses,
with their fodder, cost me more than here. If I could sell
my estates at what is probably their real value, I might
doubtless get four millions for them.” He referred me
to Rottenburg for the material for the articles. The
latter handed me for use in the article on the League of
Patriots the indictment drawn up by Tessendorf of
Leipzig, the Imperial Chief Prosecutor (21st April, 1887),
against ten inhabitants of the Reichsland (beginning
with Köchlin-Claudon of Mülhausen, and winding up
with Humbert of Metz), giving the history and description
of the association. For the second article on the
“Anti-Papal Catholics,” he sent me a few days later, by
a Chancery messenger, a report of the Oberpräsident
of Westphalia to the Minister of Public Worship, together
with about a dozen newspaper extracts. The
article on Deroulede’s horde appeared in No. 19 of the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> under the title of “The League of Patriots,”
and the other, “Embarrassments of the Centre Party,”
in No. 20 (of the 12th of May). I personally left both
at the palace for the Chancellor.</p>

<p>During May and June Bucher met Hehn and myself
regularly every Wednesday evening, sometimes at
Huth’s and sometimes at Trarbach’s. He wrote for me
the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article on “Maharajah Dhuleep Singh,”
which appeared in No. 26. He also promised a further
article for that paper, drawing a comparison between
the reigns of Queen Victoria and Queen Bess, of course
not to the advantage or credit of the former, as, according
to him, the Chief, with whom he had recently
dined, and who had invited him to pay him shortly a
visit at Friedrichsruh, wished to see something of the
kind done in connection with the Queen’s jubilee. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span>
the 28th of June Bucher started for the dragon’s lair in
the Sachsenwald, having sent me a card on the previous
day to let me know. He was back in Berlin in about
ten days. Five of these were spent at Friedrichsruh,
and the remainder of the time with Kusseroff in
Hamburg. He told me that the Chief was not disposed
to let him fire off the articles on the two English
Queens. He would think over the matter, but in any
case it should not appear in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, as that
paper’s connection with him was suspected.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1888, I received a letter from
Rottenburg requesting me to call upon him, as the
Imperial Chancellor had instructed him to discuss a
certain matter with me. I went to him on the morning
of the 2nd of March, and he told me that the Prince
wished to have a portion of Beust’s book, <a id="TN6"></a><cite lang="de">Aus drei
Viertel-Jahrhunderten</cite>, beginning on page 346 of the
second volume, dealt with in the press, and for that
purpose he would give me verbal instructions. I should
first, however, read up the book in order to inform
myself on the subject. When I had done so I was to
send him, Rottenburg, a few lines, and he would then
report to the Chancellor and let me know the day and
hour on which the latter would receive me. I borrowed
Beust’s book from Hehn on the same day, and carefully
read over the part in question several times. This referred
to the attitude of Austria before and during our
last war with France, together with the differences it
produced between Beust and Grammont. On the 5th I
wrote to Rottenburg that I now believed myself to be
sufficiently acquainted with the subject to understand
and turn to good account any further information which
the Imperial Chancellor might give me. I received no
answer, however, inviting me to see the Chief. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span>
occupied with more important matters than Beust’s
former policy, the illness and death of the Emperor
William, and the accession of his son to the throne.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 28th of March at Knoop’s
Bucher related the following particulars to myself
and Hehn. (Casually foreseeing what was generally
known a few days later, or informed of and prepared
for it.)</p>

<p>“Princess Victoria, the daughter of our new Emperor
and Empress, now about twenty-two years of age, was
to have been married some time since to the Battenberger,
who at that time was still Prince of Bulgaria,
but already a tool of English policy. He made the
acquaintance of the Queen of England’s granddaughter
during his European tour. The thought of a marriage
was probably suggested by the grandmother in London,
who wished to see the position of her servant secured
against Russia by an alliance with our Court. The
scheme leaked out, and came to the ears of the Chief.
Of course he was anything but pleased, and did not
conceal his objections from the Emperor, but on the
contrary expressed them both verbally and in a statement
which I had to prepare. It would show us in a
bad light at St. Petersburg, and it was not right to
subject a Prussian Princess to the eventuality of a compulsory
departure from Sofia. The Emperor recognised
this and issued his veto, which must have been very
unpleasant for the Crown Princess.” (...)</p>

<p><i>April 6th.</i>&mdash;On the Chief’s birthday Prince William,
now the Crown Prince, while offering his congratulations
in person, invited himself to dine with the Chancellor.
During dinner, according to the newspapers, he proposed
a toast to the following effect: “The Empire is
like an army corps that has lost its commander-in-chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span>
in the field, while the officer who stands next to him in
rank lies severely wounded. At this critical moment
forty-six million loyal German hearts turn with solicitude
and hope towards the standard and the standard bearer
in whom all their expectations are centred. The standard
bearer is our illustrious Prince, our great Chancellor.
Let him lead us. We will follow him. Long may he
live!” Coming from a member of the reigning house
such language should mean a great deal. “Our great
Chancellor”&mdash;words already used a short time ago by
his Imperial and Royal Highness&mdash;“let him lead us;
we will follow him!” What high appreciation and what
modest self-suppression and honourable subordination on
the part of the future Emperor! May God reward him
for it, and grant him victory under that standard! But
what does his mother think of it? Yesterday a Vienna
telegram in the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>, which was greeted
with scarcely concealed satisfaction by the Progressist
newspapers, reported that Bismarck intended to retire.
This leads one to think of the “Englishwoman” on the
throne of the Hohenzollerns, and of “Friedrich der
Britte” (Frederick the Briton) who is to govern according
to her views. Has the toast of the 1st instant
given offence to Guelphish self-conceit? Or has the
Chief again advised against the suitor with the Bulgarian
kalpak, who may have pressed his suit again and
with a better prospect of success after the death of the
Emperor William? At 10.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> this morning I
handed the following letter to the porter at the palace
to be immediately forwarded to the Chief: “In presence
of the extraordinary report of the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>,
which is now being circulated in the newspapers, I would
beg your Serene Highness kindly to remember that in
the future as in the past I hold myself absolutely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span>
unconditionally at your disposal, and shall always
continue to do so.”</p>

<p><i>April 7th.</i>&mdash;At 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> a Chancery attendant
brought me a letter of this day’s date from the Imperial
Chancellerie, with an appointment to call upon the
Prince at 2 o’clock. I was punctually in attendance;
but on entering the antechamber, Friedberg, the
Minister of Justice, arrived and was shown in to the
Chief before me, remaining for about three-quarters of
an hour. During this time Minister von Puttkamer
also came in, and went away again after a conversation
with Rottenburg. Thereupon the latter came to me and
said it was doubtful if the Prince could receive me to-day,
as he was very much exhausted. He had, however,
informed him that I should be there at 2 o’clock.
When he called me in, would I “make short work of it?”
I replied that that depended upon the Chancellor and not
upon me, but I would offer to come on another day if
he were not disposed for the interview at present. At
2.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Theiss showed me in to him. He was in
undress uniform, and looked quite well, although, after
he had shaken hands and asked how I was, he complained
of his nervous excitement and insomnia. “I can only
get a little sleep with the help of opium and morphia.
I am over-worked, and, in addition to that, as you have
read in the newspapers, I have latterly been worried
by the people at Charlottenburg&mdash;by the women.
The doctors insist that I should go to the country.
Schweninger prophesies that otherwise I shall suffer
from all possible forms of nervous diseases, together
with typhoid. Besides, I ought to go to Varzin, to see
after the damage done by the inundations. The Wipper
has carried away all my mills, and to rebuild them may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span>
cost hundreds of thousands; but I cannot leave, for who
knows what they would do when my back is turned&mdash;the
women who want to have a share in the government&mdash;the
Englishwomen? You have seen in the papers that
I am thinking of retiring on account of conflicts and
Court influence&mdash;not with the Emperor, who is much
more reasonable and shares my views. The question
now is as to the marriage of the Battenberger to
Princess Victoria, which the Queen of England has in
view. Three years and more ago, under the old master,
it was actively promoted by her daughter, the present
Empress, at first in secret. As soon as I then heard of
it, I made representations to the Emperor, verbally and
in writing. He allowed himself to be convinced by the
reasons I adduced, and refused to give his consent,
although she said the Princess loved him. Of course, he
is a handsome man, with a fine presence; but I believe
her nature is such that she would accept any other
suitor, providing he were manly. Moreover, that is
entirely beside the question. We must look at the
political objections and dangers. The old Queen is
fond of match-making, like all old women, and she may
have selected Prince Alexander for her granddaughter,
because he is a brother of her son-in-law, the husband of
her favourite daughter, Beatrice. But obviously her
main objects are political&mdash;a permanent estrangement
between ourselves and Russia&mdash;and if she were to come
here for the Princess’s birthday, there would be the
greatest danger that she would get her way. In family
matters she is not accustomed to contradiction, and
would immediately bring the parson with her in her
travelling bag and the bridegroom in her trunk, and the
marriage would come off at once. Probably the Battenberger,
too, would have been here by this time if I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span>
not stepped in, for they are in a mighty hurry over there
in London.”</p>

<p>I asked: “What is the actual condition of his
Majesty at Charlottenburg? Is it really cancer, and
how long is it likely to last?” He: “Cancer, and
Bergmann has already given his opinion, some time ago:
it is a question of three weeks or three months.
Externally it is not very noticeable. He holds himself
upright, and walks with a quick step. But his face (he
pointed with his fingers between the cheekbones and the
nose) has during the last few days become thinner, and
he looks tired and depressed from the excitement. They
actually ill-treated, abused and martyred him when he
declined. He is glad that I have come to his assistance,
as she is too much for him in argument. It is true that
so far only a postponement has been secured. If the
marriage nevertheless takes place, I can no longer
remain in office, for I should then have lost all confidence
in the future. That young and impetuous
woman’s will would prevail more or less in other things
too, while I should lose at St. Petersburg that reliance
on my straightforwardness which I have so laboriously
regained with the Emperor Alexander in spite of all sorts
of incitements against me. It is true that in Charlottenburg
they are most anxious to retain me&mdash;she also.
They wrap me up in cotton wool and velvet. That
also found expression in the rescript; but as the recognition
was of too generous a character it aroused in my
mind less pleasure and hope than doubt as to its
sincerity, and as to whether something was not concealed
behind it. If I can merely postpone and not
entirely prevent these English influences upon our
policy, if my remonstrances are no longer successful,
and my voice not listened to, why should I continue to
torment and overwork myself? I will not be a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span>
cloak for the follies of other people. If it were still
the old Emperor with whom I was called upon to
blunder along in this way&mdash;but to allow myself to
be made use of by this Englishwoman, for her whims,
for foreign interests, with danger and detriment to
ourselves!”</p>

<p>I said: “The Emperor was after all a splendid old
gentleman, a real King, with a high sense of duty and
well-intentioned, and who knew how to appreciate you.”</p>

<p>He: “A trustworthy comrade, who would not leave
one in the lurch.”</p>

<p>I: “It is true that he sometimes made your life a
burden, and did not always treat you well.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, but that was not done through ill-will,
but through misunderstandings and insufficient
knowledge of the matter in hand. When anything of
importance was going on he usually began by taking
the wrong road, but in the end he always allowed
himself to be put straight again. Thus during the
period of conflict when he could no longer get any
Ministers, he wished to abdicate. When I was summoned
to him at Babelsberg he had the act of abdication
ready signed. He said: ‘If I cannot find any Ministers
who will govern as I think right then my son had better
try his hand.’ I assured him that I was prepared to be
the Minister he wanted. ‘Even against the majority?’
he asked. ‘Yes, even against the majority,’ I replied.
‘Well then, that’s all right,’ he said, and tore up the
document, and with it a whole sheet of concessions to
the Liberals, which he had previously read to me.”</p>

<p>I: “Then afterwards when you travelled to Jueterbogk
to meet him. The ladies at Baden had filled him with
apprehensions as to an impending revolution, and he
already saw the scaffold awaiting him, and you&mdash;you
infused courage into him by appealing to his honour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span>
and grasping his sword knot, as you once expressed it to
me?”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, and on other occasions he had too
much courage, and wished to move too rapidly and take
too much. Thus in 1864 he wished to march into
Jutland without Austria, and at Nikolsburg to continue
the war as far as Vienna.” I recalled the attack of
hysterical weeping there. “Then at first he wanted to
have half of Saxony, half of Hanover, Ansbach and
Bayreuth, and a piece of Bohemia from Austria, until I
persuaded him how unpractical that was.”</p>

<p>“And in 1870 the military conspiracy at Mainz
before the march into France, and afterwards at Versailles
his attitude towards the claims of the Bavarians?” I
added.</p>

<p>He: “Certainly, when they actually proposed to
proceed to violence against Bavaria and afterwards intended
to deny her rights which she was entitled to claim.”</p>

<p>I said: “The expression ‘cloak’ reminds me of its
converse. Monarchs are often adorned with other
people’s feathers. If a battle is won at which one of
them happens to be present as a spectator, he is said to
have won it, although of course the staff has really
won it; and so it is in your case in the field of politics.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” he replied; “but if the work is done
and succeeds that is the main point. It is a matter
of indifference who did it.”</p>

<p>He reflected for a moment, and then continued:
“The new Empress has always been an Englishwoman,
a channel for English influence here, an instrument for
the furtherance of English interests. In her present
position she is more than ever so, and the Battenberger
is to be another tool of the same kind. In England
they do not tolerate any foreign influence&mdash;you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span>
how Palmerston and the others accused, opposed and
persecuted the Prince Consort for his alleged or real
influence over the Queen. We however are expected to
submit to that sort of thing, and regard it as a matter
of course. We are an inferior race, ordained to serve
them. So the Queen thinks too, and her daughter is of
exactly the same opinion. They are working in partnership.
I would suggest to you to take the present
opportunity of treating this subject fully, dealing with
it from a diplomatic and historical standpoint, showing
how England has at all times sought and still seeks to
influence us for her own ends, and often against our
interest, to use us for promoting her own security and
the extension of her power, lately through women,
daughters and friends of Queen Victoria. In doing so,
please to make use of a small work that was published
a few years ago in Switzerland under the title of <cite>Co-Regents
and Foreign Influence in Germany</cite> (<cite lang="de">Mitregenten
und fremde Hände in Deutschland</cite>). The anonymous
author is not unknown to me. It is Duke Ernst of
Coburg, and his account is on the whole correct.”</p>

<p>I said: “Doubtless it must be, since he belongs to
the clique: Leopold of Belgium, Victoria in London,
Victoria in Berlin, Stockmar, and also Josias Bunsen
in the heyday of his career.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, but that is no longer the case, as you
will see when you read the pamphlet. You can go
further back, however. Give a survey of English policy
during the last couple of centuries.”</p>

<p>I: “Something of the kind must have existed even
previously. An Englishman was once even German Emperor,
Richard of Cornwall, before Rudolf of Hapsburg.”</p>

<p>He: “Yes, but confine yourself to modern history,
going back as far as the beginning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span>
last century. Throughout that period the policy
of England has constantly been to sow dissensions
between the Continental Powers or to maintain existing
discord, on the principle of <i lang="la" title="When two go to law a third rejoices">Duobus litigantibus tertius
gaudens</i>, and to use the one against the other so that
they should be weakened and damaged for the benefit
of England. These efforts were first directed against
France, then against Russia. First it was the Emperor
in Vienna who had to wage war on their behalf, and
then we were to take up the cudgels for them. Remember
the Spanish War of Succession and the Battle
of Dettingen. At that time it is true every State in
Europe was threatened in its liberty and existence by
the universal monarchy which was then in course of
development in France, but none so much as England
herself. And then think of the Seven Years’ War in
which the English took the lion’s share of the booty,
although they had ventured and accomplished comparatively
little, while we conquered the French colonies
for them. Latterly they have tried to play us off
against the Russians who have become a danger for
them on the Bosphorus, and still more on their Indian
frontier. We are expected to make good the deficiencies
of their military forces, threaten the Russian flank, and
hold them back when they propose to march. First,
during the Crimean War, in which by the way the
French had little reason to join, we were urged, quite
against our own interests, to co-operate with the Western
Powers in opposing the Emperor Nicholas. I assisted
in preventing that. Later on, in 1863, England wanted
to see the Polish insurrection supported, as a means of
weakening Russia, a course whereby we should have
forfeited an old friend who might prove a still better
friend to us in the future, and have gained no trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span>
friendship in the West by way of compensation;
while in the Poles we should have strengthened an
ancient foe, and created a natural ally for France. In
1877, when it was seen that a Russo-Turkish war was
imminent, we were expected to exert our influence
at St. Petersburg to prevent it&mdash;in the interest of
humanity&mdash;as <cite>The Times</cite> demonstrated. Queen Victoria
urged us to do so in a letter to the Emperor, which was
handed to him by Augusta, who added her own intercession,
and in two letters to myself. Humanity, peace
and liberty,&mdash;those are always their pretexts when they
cannot by way of a change invoke Christianity and the
extension of the blessings of civilisation to savage and
semi-barbarous peoples. In reality, however, <cite>The Times</cite>
and the Queen wrote in the interests of England, which
had nothing in common with ours. It is in the interest
of England that the German Empire should be
on bad terms with Russia. Our interest is that we
should be on as good terms with Russia as the situation
allows. Latterly I have directed my endeavours
towards this end, and I have succeeded, in spite of
various opposing influences;&mdash;and now the Battenberger
is to be called in to nullify my success, to inspire the
Emperor Alexander with fresh suspicions, and to supply
the Moscow press with plausible grounds, which would
have at least appearances in their favour, for asserting
that we entertain secret designs. Prince Alexander, who
has been selected as bridegroom for the daughter of the
German Emperor, would, if that marriage were to take
place, not only appear but actually be a permanent
channel for English influence with us&mdash;that is the essence
of the scheme&mdash;emphasise and repeat that&mdash;so far as
this influence is directed against Russia. He is really a
Pole, through his mother, who married, as a Fräulein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span>
Hauke, a member of a family which is neither old nor
illustrious. (...) Such a relationship is decidedly not
suitable for the Prussian Royal House and a daughter of
the German Emperor. The Emperor Frederick sees and
feels that too, perhaps even more than we do, for he has a
very high opinion of his family and its dignity. But apart
from that the more important point is that the Emperor
Alexander hates the Battenberger with his whole heart,
indeed there is perhaps no one else whom he knows and
hates so thoroughly.”</p>

<p>I said: “The unheard-of rudeness of the letter
striking his name off the Army List, a communication
well nigh unparalleled in the intercourse of Princes.”</p>

<p>He rejoined: “Yes, and other things too. But he
richly deserved it through his falsehood and treachery.
As a nephew of the deceased Empress he was regarded
in St. Petersburg as a fitting instrument for advancing
Russian interests as Prince of Bulgaria; and that was quite
legitimate in view of the gratitude which the Bulgarians
owed to Russia for their liberation, while it was also the
ultimate and real object of the war of 1877. At first he
governed in this sense, but he afterwards took up with
the English, who wished to create a Greater Bulgaria to
serve their purposes, and like Rumania be under obligations
to them. It was to be developed into a new kingdom,
which should stand in the way of Russia. That had
been planned long beforehand, and the way had been
prepared by various measures; but the Prince always
tried to dispel any uneasiness by beautifully reassuring
speeches and categorical promises. Finally he pledged
himself to Giers not to make any kind of change in
Eastern Rumelia; and yet shortly afterwards the revolution
broke out in Philippopolis, with his previous knowledge
and co-operation. It would be a miracle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span>
utterly opposed to human nature, if the Emperor
Alexander did not hate him with a deadly hatred for this
dishonourable conduct, this breach of faith. He will
never forgive him, and will always look upon him as a sworn
enemy, embittered moreover by having been driven out.
If he were accepted as a member of the German
Imperial House, it would fill the Emperor with a
suspicion which nothing could dissipate. It would be a
permanent threat to peace. He would not on that account
declare war upon us immediately and without more ado,
as Napoleon did in similar circumstances in 1870; but he
would hold it to be a confirmation of all the old doubts
as to our sincerity which we had proved to be unfounded,
and the Russian press would renew its agitation with the
same violence and malice as formerly, and with more
success. It is not yet certain that Russia would take up
arms against us if we were to be again attacked by the
French; but if the Russians were to declare war upon us
the French would certainly join them immediately.
And after all in such a war we should not be so very
certain to win, while it would be a great misfortune even
if we were victorious, as in any case we should lose a
great deal of blood and treasure, and also suffer considerable
indirect damage through the interruption of work
and trade, and we should never be able to take anything
from the French or Russians that would compensate us
for our losses. It is only the English who would benefit
by it. It would be an English war if the Battenberg
marriage led Russia to join the French attack on us.
We are well armed, but at all events large masses of
troops would be put into the field against us, and
Austria has not yet developed her defensive forces as she
could and should do; and no real confidence could be
placed in Italy. It is possible that the French may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>
regain their footing there and win back the Italian
friendship, if other parties came into power. Indeed
even a Republic is possible, and Italy may resume her
irredentist schemes and claims against Austria.”</p>

<p>I said: “I shall keep all that in mind, and write
the article as well as I can. Perhaps I may be allowed
to mention the influence brought to bear by the English
ladies against the bombardment of Paris. You remember:
‘Schurze und Schürzen’” (aprons and petticoats;
that is to say, freemasons and women).</p>

<p>“Yes, do that,” he replied; “but at the same time
remember the press laws. Be very cautious, diplomatic,
and not too venomous; and always emphasise the fact
that it is foreign influences that are working against
me; not the Emperor, but the reigning lady and her
mother.”... “But,” I said, “will it not throw an
unfavourable light on the Emperor, making him appear
weak and pitiable, if one says that he is opposed to the
Battenberg project, but may be brought to give in to
the demands of the ladies?” He replied: “It is not
necessary to say that in so many words; but it is
nevertheless a fact&mdash;and it was much the same with
the late Emperor, who had also to struggle against
feminine influence, and was thankful to me when I
stiffened him against it. In these cases he used to say
to me: ‘Do it in such a manner that they may fancy
they have had their way, while we really manage as it
should be.’ On the whole, I got on well with him.”</p>

<p>After I had been with him somewhat over three-quarters
of an hour, he called my attention to a very
curious little work of art which stood on his writing-table.
It consisted of a large grey pearl mounted with
diamonds and rubies, representing the head of a greyhound
with a golden tobacco pipe in its mouth. This,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span>
he explained, was “a present from Mexico.” I then
took my leave, and he was about to lie down to sleep.
In the antechamber Theiss told me that while I had
been with the Chancellor the Grand Duke of Baden
called to see him. He had told him, however, that
the Prince “had a conference,” and he accordingly
went away. I proceeded direct to Bucher’s in order
to repeat to him as literally as possible my conversation
with the Chief, and thus to impress it more firmly on
my mind. He had the Duke of Coburg’s pamphlet,
which he lent me. He also gave me the following
example of the manner in which the feminine half of
the present Imperial family have been anglicised.
“Princess Victoria, the Battenbergerin <i lang="la" title="in hope">in spe</i>, had a
difference with her brother on one occasion respecting
some household arrangement. ‘After all, that is much
better managed at home,’ she said. ‘At home? What
do you mean?’ he asked. ‘Why, at home in England,’
she replied. The particular epithet which Prince
William applied to her is not known for certain, but it
was either ‘goose’ or ‘sheep’”. (...)</p>

<p>On my return home at 6 o’clock I found the
following note, enclosing an extract from the <cite lang="de">Deutsches
Tageblatt</cite>, lying on my table:&mdash;“Dear Sir,&mdash;Prince
Bismarck begs you to kindly introduce the article discussed
to-day by a reference to the enclosed statements
of <cite>The Times</cite>, in order that it should not appear to be
written without any immediate occasion.&mdash;Yours truly,
<span class="smcap">Rottenburg</span>.”</p>

<p>On the 8th of April, having again been summoned
to the Chief, I called at the Chancellor’s palace, and was
shown in without much delay. The Prince, who was
reclining in a <i lang="fr">chaise longue</i> near the window, was reading
the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>. I had to draw up an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>
armchair close to him. He said: “Here is the
<cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite> writing against <cite>The Times</cite>, and
also the <cite lang="de">Frankfurter Zeitung</cite>. You might also mention
this in the article of which we were speaking yesterday,
and correct them where necessary. The main point is
that the Emperor is on my side. A syllable must be
added here” (he pointed to the word “Kaiser,” which
was underlined in red)&mdash;“Kaiser<em>in</em>. It is a struggle
between the Emperor and Empress. She, as an Englishwoman,
is in favour of the Battenberger; he will not
have him, first for political reasons, like myself, and
then because he actually hates him, for he dislikes the
idea of a <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i>, as he is very proud of his dynasty
and position. Two Empresses are fighting against his
opinion and mine,&mdash;those of India and Germany; and
Victoria the daughter simply talks him down. She
can make much better use of her tongue than he can.
It has always been so, and now more than ever, owing
to his illness and the way in which worry affects him.
Besides, he is deeply devoted to his family. I was
present on one occasion when she set at him so
violently with her feminine logic and volubility that
at last he sat there quite silent and depressed. He
is delighted every time that I come to his assistance
against his combative wife.” I related Bucher’s story
about Victoria No. 3 and her brother. “Yes,” he said,
“that is quite credible. At home with her daughters,
she, the German Empress, only speaks English, the
language of the Chosen People, and the Princesses write
English letters to their father.”</p>

<p>He continued: “Look here! There they talk of my
attachment to the dynasty. Well, that is quite correct,
but it was more so under the father, the old master. I
had all along wanted to retire at his death, and if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span>
remain it may be taken as certain that I do so only on
an understanding that I continue the old policy I have
followed hitherto, and am protected from foreign influence
and from the interference and misgovernment of
women, which was never carried to such lengths as it
is at present. I would therefore beg of you to call
attention to the Progressist journals, to these Court
Jacobins&mdash;use that word&mdash;who receive their orders from
Charlottenburg, through the women whose names figure
at the head of the Address, Frau Helmholtz, Schrader,
and Stockmar, whose late husband was Secretary to the
Englishwoman when she was Crown Princess. These
Byzantine hypocrites, these democrats who wag their
tails and crawl more abjectly than the most extravagant
absolutist, would like to degrade me from being a servant
of the State and of its head into a Court menial, although
of course it is both my right and my duty to form my
own opinion and maintain it like anybody else, all the
more as I bear the responsibility for the mistakes, or, as
in the present instance, the obvious follies that are committed
in important matters.” He continued to dilate
on this theme for a few minutes; and then again
suggested that I should make use of the pamphlet of
Duke Ernst of Coburg. He sent for Rottenburg, and
told him that in using it elsewhere the passages which I
should quote were not to be employed. When Rottenburg
had gone I asked: “Are you quite sure that it
was he who wrote it? It is very strong for him,
although from the style, which is rather vulgar and
careless, it might well be his work, besides which he is
acquainted with the facts through being closely connected
with the Queen.” He replied, smiling: “He
himself told me so” (in English). I then spoke of his
autobiography, which I described as badly arranged and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span>
prolix. “Yes,” he said, “he has somewhat the same
failing as Beust. He can suppress nothing&mdash;not the
most trifling circumstance respecting what he has done
or tried to do, and collected.” I inquired as to the
instructions respecting Beust’s book. He replied:
“That must wait. We have now more important
matters to deal with. Later on, perhaps. For the
present you might get them to give you the book. I
have underlined a few things which appear to me to be
incorrect. But now I must try to get some sleep. At
present my pulse goes on an average fifteen beats in the
minute faster than it did during the preceding reign.” I
took my leave, with good wishes for his speedy improvement.
I had been with him about twenty minutes.
In the following three days I wrote the desired article,
and sent it to the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>, where it appeared in
No. 17, under the title, “Foreign Influences in the
Empire.”</p>

<p><i>April 25th.</i>&mdash;This evening at Knoop’s, Bucher
described the candidature of the Prince of Hohenzollern,
in which he himself had taken a part, as a “trap for
Napoleon.” He added that neither the Emperor William
nor the Crown Prince had the least idea of this feature
of Bismarck’s manœuvre, of which he, Bucher, also gave
particulars to the Crown Prince after his journey.
They both regarded the candidature as a means of
exalting the glory of their House.</p>

<p><i>April 28th.</i>&mdash;This afternoon met Bucher in the
Königin Augusta Strasse.... He said, smiling: “I
have just heard a surprising piece of news. Grandmamma
behaved quite sensibly at Charlottenburg. She
declared the attitude of the Chief in the Battenberg
marriage scheme to be quite correct, and urged her
daughter to change her ways. Of course it was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span>
nice of her not to forget her own country and to wish
to benefit it where it was possible for her to do so, but
she needed the attachment of the Germans, and should
endeavour to secure it; and finally she brought about a
reconciliation between Prince William and his mother.”
I asked, “Have you that on good authority?” “On
very good authority,” he replied. “Well,” I said, “that
is highly satisfactory, and we shall act accordingly in
the immediate future, for, of course, we do not hate
Victoria <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> on account of her extraction, but because
she feels as an Englishwoman and wishes to promote
English interests at our expense, and because she
despises us Germans. The question is whether in the
long run she will heed this maternal admonition. It is
not easy to rid one’s self of a habit of thought of such
long standing.” He agreed with me in this.</p>

<p><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;I read this morning in the <cite lang="de">Berliner
Boersenzeitung</cite>: “We are in a position to state that
the Imperial Chancellor, as was indeed to be expected, is
most indignant at the notorious article in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
slandering the Empress Victoria, and that he has given
expression to his condemnation in very strong terms.
In this connection exceptional importance is to be
attached to the sympathetic article in the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</cite> on the Queen of England’s visit.”
Doubtless as that paper is in the Bleichröder’s service, this
utterance has been inspired by that firm, over which floats
the flag of the British Consulate General. Well informed?
Possibly, indeed probably. A disclaimer? Why not!
Quite in order! <i lang="la" title="Times are changing?">Tempora mutantur</i>? But I shall
never change towards him, nor he doubtless towards me.
He will once more call for his little archer when he
again wants an arrow shot into the face of this or that
sun, and “Büschlein’s” bow shall never fail him. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>
“libellous article” was, I see, indignantly denounced in
the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> and the <cite lang="de">Neue Freie Presse</cite>. In
doing so the former described the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> as “a
publication which, for well-known reasons, is read with
attention throughout Germany.” The <cite lang="de">Neue Freie Presse</cite>
spoke of a want of tact which would be regarded as
impossible if it were not in evidence in black on white.
Excellent! In this manner what I had written secured
a wide circulation, particularly as other journalistic hacks
will probably without wishing it have recommended the
article in a similar way. (...)</p>

<p>After the death of the Emperor Frederick, I wrote to
Bucher a few lines expressing the satisfaction I felt that
we were relieved of that incubus, and that his place was
now to be taken by a disciple and admirer of the Chief.</p>

<p><i>July 16th.</i>&mdash;After it had been whispered in the press
for some time that the Emperor Frederick had left a
diary which did not throw a very favourable light upon
Bismarck, and that this was at present in the hands of
the Queen of England, a second version of the story
(<cite lang="de">Berliner Boersenzeitung</cite>, evening edition of the 13th) is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>
now reproduced from the <cite lang="fr">Matin</cite> and other French
papers. This is to the following effect. During the
lifetime of the Emperor William <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> Prince Bismarck
prepared a frank statement respecting the European
situation and his own political views, which he handed
to the Emperor, believing that the latter would survive
his son, and that the document would thus pass direct,
without any intermediary, from the grandfather to the
grandson. Frederick ascended the throne, and found
the Bismarck memorandum. All the efforts made by
the Chancellor to recover possession of it were in vain,
and on Frederick’s death it was found that the document,
which contained the most secret ideas and
schemes of the Chancellor, had come into the possession
of Queen Victoria, who declined to give it up. In this
form the story is doubtless akin to that of the sea-serpent,
and yet it is perhaps not entirely without foundation.
Anyhow, it is possible that a diary by the
late Emperor may be in existence, and may have been
put into a place of safety by his consort or her
mother.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September I received from Grunow
the October number of the <cite lang="de">Deutsche Rundschau</cite>, containing
the diary of the Emperor Frederick during the
war. I reviewed it in No. 40 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
without having any doubt as to its being in the main
genuine. On the 24th Hedwig announced the arrival
of one of the Chancery attendants who had been sent
by Rottenburg to request me to call upon him at 2.30
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I went, and he showed me a letter from the Imperial
Chancellor (written by an amanuensis) desiring
him to request me to come to Friedrichsruh, and to
bring with me my notes taken during the war, as the
diary of the Emperor Frederick appeared to contain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span>
inaccuracies. I promised to start next morning, whereupon
Rottenburg arranged to telegraph to Rantzau to
stop the 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> train at Friedrichsruh where it does
not usually stop. Nothing was to be said in the newspapers
about my visit. I replied that that went
without saying so far as it depended upon me. I had
always felt disgusted at the merest mention of my
name by that pack. On the same evening Rottenburg
sent me a letter requesting me not to leave Berlin, but
to come to the Imperial Chancellerie at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the
following morning, as other arrangements had been
made.</p>

<p>I appeared punctually at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in the Chancellor’s
antechamber, where I met the Secretary of State, Von
Schelling (medium height, red face, white hair and
small white moustache) who was shown in to the
Prince before me. As Rottenburg informed me while
I was waiting, the Chancellor had arrived and wished to
see me. He added, however, that he might not be able
to see me now, in which case I should return at 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
Rottenburg also inquired if I had already found any inaccuracies
in the diary published in the <cite lang="de">Rundschau</cite>.
I replied that so far I had only noticed some trifling
errors, and that on the whole I considered it to be
genuine, but not complete. Schelling remained for
half an hour. On his leaving, Rantzau came out and
spoke to Rottenburg, whereupon the latter again requested
me to return at 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, as the Chief was too
much occupied to be able to speak to me now. On my
return at the hour named he said that the Chancellor
had still no time to receive me and was going back to
Friedrichsruh that evening. There was, therefore, no
alternative but for me to go there likewise. It would
be well if I were to start next morning and telegraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span>
to him shortly before my departure in order that he
might arrange for the train to stop at Friedrichsruh.
I promised to leave by the 8.30 train from the Lehrter
station, which arrives at Friedrichsruh about 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
and also to take with me my notes, of which he again
reminded me.</p>

<p><i>September 26th.</i>&mdash;About one o’clock I arrived at
Friedrichsruh station, where Rottenburg was waiting
with a carriage for Count Solms, our Ambassador in
Rome&mdash;who travelled by the same train&mdash;and myself.
On our way to the house, the Privy Councillor told us
that the Prince had gone out for a walk in order to
freshen himself up, as he had done a great deal of work
last night. At 2.15 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I met him at lunch, at which
the Princess, Rantzau and his wife, his Excellency von
Solms, and a Prioress, whose name I have forgotten,
were also present. The Chief, as was his custom
formerly at Varzin and here, read through, signed and
otherwise disposed of various documents. After lunch
Rottenburg, on his instructions, handed me a memorandum
on the diary published in the <cite lang="de">Rundschau</cite>. This was
directed to the Emperor and was to appear next day in
the <cite lang="de">Reichsanzeiger</cite>. While I was reading this through
in his study, the Chief came in, asked me to give it to
him, and made a few corrections and additions in it.
I then read it through in my own room upstairs, after
which the Chancery attendant, Kleist, took it away.
I then chatted with the three little Rantzaus, who were
trying their skill at archery at an improvised target
near the coach-house; advised them in the matter, and
in that way, apparently, won the good will of the still
very childlike and unaffected boys. Then a short walk
with Solms in the park on the banks of the Aue. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span>
my return, I found a carriage standing before the door
of the house; and the Chief sent word to say that he
was going out for a drive, and would I like to come
with him. Of course I would. We then drove for
about two hours, first to Silt, afterwards to Schönau and
finally to the Billenbrück, and then home through the
beech wood on the right bank of the Aue. On the way,
the Prince spoke to two gamekeepers about the scarcity
of partridges and the fish poachers; while he discussed
the state of the crops, and the condition of the cattle
with a cowherd whose charges were feeding in a field of
vetches. Further on, he entered into conversation with
overseers who were looking after the potato digging and
with labourers who were ploughing with oxen. In the
intervals he had a long conversation with me on the
manner in which the Crown Prince’s diary should be
dealt with. He introduced the subject by the remark
(in English): “I am afraid you have forgotten your
English.” On my answering, “No, sir, by no means,”
he continued the conversation in that language on
account of the coachman. He began: “As you will
have seen from what you read, we must first treat it as
a forgery, a point of view from which a great deal may
be said. Then, when it is proved to be genuine by the
production of the original it can be dealt with further
in another way.” I said that on the whole it appeared
to me to be genuine, but incomplete, on the one hand,
while, on the other, there were interpolations, probably
by Victoria No. 2, in support of which opinion I quoted
examples. I also told him that, in ignorance of his
plans, I had already dealt with the matter in the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> a week before, according to my own views,
and in certain flagrant instances condemned it cautiously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span>
Another course was, however, still open to me. I then
repeated to him, from memory, the commencement of
the article in question. He rejoined: “You were quite
right. I myself consider the diary even more genuine
than you do. It is quite insignificant, superficial stuff,
without any true conception of the situation, a medley
of sentimental politics, self-conceit and phrase-mongering.
He was far from being as clever as his father, and the
latter was certainly not a first-rate politician. It is
just that which proves its genuineness to me. But at
first we must treat it as doubtful.” The conversation
then turned on the details of the diary. I asked if he
had spoken to the Emperor on the subject, and he replied
in the affirmative, saying: “He was quite in a rage and
wishes to have strong measures taken against the publication.”
He then came to speak of the demand for
Imperial Ministers. We have them, of course, only without
the title and name. The Imperial Chancellor is their
permanent President,&mdash;permanent, because with us the
power of the Emperor is greater under the Constitution
than in other countries which are ruled by alternating
Parliamentary majorities. I suggested that Gustav
Freytag might perhaps at the instance of the Empress
Victoria have edited the diary and arranged for its
publication. I tried to show the probability of this
suggestion by a reference to his political views, to the
confidential position which he occupied towards the two
Victorias, and in particular to an instruction to Brater’s
paper in Frankfurt in the summer of 1863, during the
conflict between the King and the Crown Prince respecting
the “Press Ordinances.” He considered, however,
that the trick would prove to have been done by Hengst,
a writer who serves the Court, and particularly its ladies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span>
in the press. He then repeated the main points of the
memorandum which I had previously read. I now ascertained
for certain that this was a report on the diary in the
<cite lang="de">Deutsche Rundschau</cite> which the Chancellor, by the Emperor’s
command, had submitted to the sovereign a few
days ago. He added various details: “In 1870 the
Crown Prince was only partially initiated into the negotiations,
as the King feared that he would write about
them either to his consort, or direct to Queen Victoria
and her Court, whose sympathies were with the French.
In the second place, he might also have done harm, as
his views with regard to the demands upon our German
allies went too far, and he was thinking of coercive
measures which were urged upon him by his good friends
at Baden and Coburg&mdash;as, for instance, Roggenbach, who
always was a fool. He had therefore only a superficial
knowledge of the course of affairs. It is, nevertheless,
surprising that these notes, which are supposed to have
been written down day by day, contain so many misconceptions,
confusions and chronological errors. A great
deal of it cannot possibly have been written by
the Crown Prince, and must have come from his <i lang="fr">entourage</i>
or the publisher. Here it is said that, in the
middle of July, I wanted to return to Varzin because peace
was no longer in danger, while he, of course, knew that
I considered war to be inevitable, and had declared my
intention to retire when the King showed a disposition
to yield. It is also inconceivable that the Crown Prince
endeavoured at an early date to secure the Iron Cross
for non-Prussians, in view of the fact that at Versailles he
was opposed to it, and it was I who first suggested it. He
represents this as the beginning of the struggle between
him and me as to the future of Germany, although he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span>
must surely have remembered former differences of
opinion between us, that led to some very lively discussions
which one would not be likely to forget. It
was before or immediately after Sedan, at Beaumont or
Donchery, and the conversation took place in a long
avenue through which we rode side by side. We came
to high words over our respective views as to what was
expedient and morally permissible, and when he spoke
of force and of coercive measures against the Bavarians
I reminded him of the Margrave Gero and the thirty
Wendish Princes, and also of the Sendling massacre.
When he held to his opinion, however, and suggested
that I should carry it into execution, I said to him
(scarcely in so blunt and plain a fashion) that there were
things which a Prince, perhaps, might do, but no gentleman
would attempt. Such conduct would be an act of
perfidy, and an outrage upon allies who had fulfilled
their obligations, quite apart from the folly of such an
attempt at a time when we had further use for them.
The statements in the alleged diary as to my position in
the Emperor question in 1866, on my intentions in
connection with the dogma of infallibility, my idea of
an Upper House and the Imperial Ministries, can hardly
have been written by the Crown Prince either. In 1870
he could no longer doubt that the Empire, in the form
which he had in his mind in 1866, would have been
neither useful nor feasible&mdash;in fact it would not have
been an Empire at all. What he desired in 1866 was
not an Emperor but a King of Germany&mdash;the other
Kings and Grand Dukes being reduced to their former
rank, merely Dukes&mdash;as if that were an easy matter to
bring about. We had already put an end to the Upper
House at Beaumont or Donchery, and had dealt with
the Imperial Ministers in like fashion. He, too, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>
have finally recognised that the dogma of infallibility was
of slight importance for us, and that I regarded it as a
blunder on the part of the Pope and advised the King to
let it rest during the continuance of the war. Even a
hasty thinker like the Crown Prince could scarcely have
concluded from that that I intended to oppose it after
the war, and therefore this passage was doubtless not
written by him. At least for the present we must continue
to doubt the genuineness of this and other statements.”
He then spoke of Bray, who, as an Austrian
sympathiser, delayed the mobilisation of the Bavarian
troops in 1870; and of King Lewis, who&mdash;at that
time of sound German principles&mdash;was “our sole influential
friend in Bavaria.” Returning to the Crown
Prince’s idea of 1866 and to his Upper Chamber, the
Chancellor observed: “An Emperor or King of North
Germany would have created a division between North
and South Germany such as did not exist under the
Customs Union; and an Upper House with Princes and
elected members was impossible.” I then reminded
him of the importunity of Baden and Coburg, who at
Versailles worried him with memorials and verbal
counsels, questions, &amp;c., to that effect, and of his indignation
at the unexpected visit of the Grand Duke
Frederick during dinner. I then mentioned to him
what Bucher had told me about the sensible attitude
adopted by the Queen of England at Charlottenburg,
which he confirmed, adding that at the interview which
he had had with her he had in part prompted the
admonitions which she addressed to her daughter. In
this connection I asked whether the statement in
Bleichröder’s <cite lang="de">Boersenzeitung</cite> as to his strong condemnation
of my article, “Foreign Influences in the Empire,”
were true. I added that, <i lang="la" title="things being changed">rebus mutatis</i>, I should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span>
considered it quite conceivable, and had indeed said as
much. He replied, smiling: “Nonsense! quite the
contrary. I have several times expressed my high
appreciation of it. The article was really quite first
rate, and the Coburg pamphlet was also very aptly
applied.” Driving along in the dusk on the right bank
of the Aue, we passed a boarding school, and were
greeted with cheers three times repeated by a crowd of
children (doubtless the pupils and their teacher). “They
will,” he said, “have taken the grey-bearded gentleman
seated by me for a Rumanian or Bulgarian Minister on
a visit.” “Then I too have had a share in the ovation,”
I rejoined, “and shall take it with me to Berlin as
a souvenir.” He afterwards requested me to look
through my diary to-morrow, to see if there were any
further chronological or other mistakes in the publication
of the <cite lang="de">Deutsche Rundschau</cite> and to report to him on the
subject.</p>

<p>After dinner, which began at 7 o’clock and lasted
for about an hour, coffee and cognac were served in the
next room, while the Prince seated himself on a sofa in
the corner, behind a table with a lamp. There he read
the newspapers and smoked a long pipe. We followed
suit with cigars. I had some conversation with Rantzau,
who is now about to leave for his post at Munich, concerning
“<span lang="de">Friedrich der Sachte</span>,” and my intercourse
with him and his “Ministers,” as well as on the old
Schleswig-Holstein agitation. The Princess then brought
me a book kept by her, in which I had to write my name
and the date. I was preceded in this by various distinguished
and eminent people, celebrities of the day,
Ministers, Ambassadors, Envoys, &amp;c. It will one day
be an interesting collection. Afterwards met Solms
upstairs in the corridor leading to his and my room, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span>
hastily gave him a little (well deserved) praise for his
sharp diplomatic scent in the months preceding the
French war. This moved him to invite me to his room,
where he gave me detailed particulars of his experiences
and achievements at that time, but unfortunately in
French, whereby some points were lost to me. (...)</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th I again spoke to the
Ambassador as he was on the point of starting for Berlin
and Rome. “Adieu, old friend, and if you ever come
to the Eternal City be sure to visit me. But what I
said to you last night about the Paris affairs must not
appear in your memoirs.” “No, Excellency, a mere
reference to the conversation without any details. I
know how to respect your confidence as well as that of
other people.” “Yes, I am convinced that you have
gathered a great deal about our affairs which does not
appear in your books.”</p>

<p>During the forenoon, in accordance with the Chief’s
desire, I went through my diary up to our stay at
Ferrières. At lunch the Prince observed, after first
recommending me to take some herring: “They are
wholesome, and I always have some since Schweninger
advised me to take fish. Moreover, it is a very fine and
good fish, and is only looked down upon because it is
so plentiful and cheap. Since I began in 1883 I must
have disposed of over a thousand of them.” In the
evening, after dinner, the Prince, while looking through
the newspapers, suddenly said: “Yes, since 1840 the
Princes have begun to degenerate. I will give you an
example or two (looking towards me). In 1858, before
Prince William, afterwards Emperor, acted as Regent
for his brother, there was a reactionary intrigue on foot
with which Manteuffel was not unconnected, and in
which they also wanted me to join. Its object was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span>
induce the sick King to withdraw his authority, and to
let Queen Elizabeth govern through the Ministers. I
did not join in that scheme, but on the contrary started
for Baden&mdash;or was it somewhere else in South Germany?&mdash;and
told the whole story to him (the Prince of
Prussia). He was not at all disconcerted by the plan,
however, and declared himself ready to retire immediately.
It was therefore a matter of perfect indifference
to him. But I argued it out with him. What will be
the result of such a move? It is surely your duty to
hold on! Send for Manteuffel at once. And Manteuffel
actually came, after having hesitated for some little
time, excusing himself on the ground of illness, and so
the affair went no further. Then at Babelsberg, when I
was called thither in order to be made Minister. In his
despair he had the act of abdication ready signed, and it
was only when I offered to stand by him in spite of
Parliament and in spite of the majority that he tore it
up. This restored his courage and confidence and his
sense of royal duty, which in his unfortunate position
had, until then, been a matter of utter indifference to
him. He afterwards held to it firmly enough.” The
Chancellor added that of late years the deceased monarch
through this sense of duty had sometimes caused him
considerable difficulties, as his knowledge of affairs was
limited and he was slow in comprehending anything
new. Of the present Emperor he said: “He has more
understanding, more courage and greater independence
of Court influences, but in his leaning towards me he
goes far. How considerate he was the last time he came
here! He was surprised that I had waited for him till
11 o’clock, a thing which his grandfather was
incapable of saying. And in the morning he waited for
me, and although he is accustomed to rise much earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span>
he did not get up until 9 o’clock, thinking that I
slept till that hour. I was just washing and only half
dressed when he put his hand on my shoulder, and I
hurriedly pulled on my dressing gown in order to be to
some extent in a proper condition to receive him.” I
said: “Yes, Serene Highness, you now appear to have
everything one could wish for you. A docile and grateful
pupil and warm admirer stands by your side as ruler
and chief authority in the State, and we, your people,
rejoice with all our hearts, and hope that it may long
remain so.”</p>

<p>“It is only in trifles and matters of secondary importance
that one had occasionally some little reason to
find fault with him, as for instance in the form of his
pronouncements. After all, that was a little too much
of a good thing when he said: ‘Forty-two millions and
eighteen army corps on the field.’ ‘If at last the whole
nation lies hushed in the silence of death.’ If every
German soldier and civilian is dead, what significance
can the independence and inviolability of Germany still
have? And new-fangled words from the newspapers,
such as ‘<i lang="de" title="constantly">unentwegt</i>,’ ‘<i lang="de" title="fully and completely">voll und ganz</i>,’ to say nothing of
‘<i lang="de" title="in this regard">diesbezüglich</i>,’ do not look well in his proclamation.”
The Prince rejoined: “In his reference to the battle-field
it would certainly have been enough had he said:
‘And if I were to be the last man upon the field of
battle nothing that we have conquered shall be lost!’
But that is youthful vivacity, which time will correct.
Better too much than too little fire!” I then conversed
with Countess Rantzau, and recommended to her a
climatic cure, deep breathing in the open air. He
looked up from his paper and said: “Pulmonary
gymnastics? I too have tried that, and still do occasionally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span></p>

<p>Up to lunch time on the morning of the 28th I
read through my diary, and came upon a number of
passages that seemed likely to be of use to the Chief.
On being called down to lunch I met a gentleman who
was paying a private visit. He was introduced to me
as Privy Councillor of Embassy Brauer, a portly man of
about thirty-six, who has a slight touch of the South-west
German accent. The conversation turned on the Crown
Prince, and the shallowness and poverty of thought
which characterised his diary. From this the Chief
again concluded that the publication in the <cite lang="de">Deutsche
Rundschau</cite>, or at least a great part of it, might be
genuine. He again spoke in English on account of the
servants. I took the liberty to remark that according
to page 138 of my diary it appeared after all that he
had had a conversation on the German question with
his Royal Highness at Versailles on the 16th. He
rejoined: “Yes, but then he has mixed it up with a
former one, and moreover I cannot have advised him to
propose to the King that the Bavarians should be disarmed.”
I added that that must have been said
ironically&mdash;a suggestion of such a monstrous description
that no one could take it seriously.</p>

<p>On his rising from table to go to his study, I
followed him outside in order to tell him privately
that I had found some passages in my diary which
might be of interest to him, mentioning in particular
Fleming’s despatch on Mohl’s report. He said he
would like to see them in the afternoon, and would
send for me for the purpose. “I must now answer
Augusta, who has once more administered to me one of
her gracious Model Letter-Writer epistles.” Later on,
when I brought him the diary with the passages of
interest marked, he praised Mohl’s description of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span>
relations of parties in Bavaria as apt and accurate. On
my saying that it would doubtless have been in the
hands of the Grand Duke of Baden three months before
the differences at Versailles, and that he would certainly
have communicated its contents to the Crown Prince,
he answered in a tone of contempt: “Ah, that is mere
talk on his part. He never took anything seriously, or
studied it thoroughly. Do you really think that they
were seriously concerned, to read despatches, and to
think over and note the contents of reports? They
just met in order to smoke and exchange ill-natured
gossip.” He then related once more: “It was before
the conference at Donchery when he spoke of using
force against the Bavarians, and of eventually shooting
down the two army corps if necessary. I said to him
that would be an act of unheard-of treachery, which a
Prince might decide upon, but which no gentleman
could perform. That would be a course similar to
Gero’s, in his treatment of the thirty Wendish Princes,
a perfidy which had such fatal consequences for the
whole Ostmark.” On this occasion he also repeated his
plan of campaign with regard to the publication in the
<cite lang="de">Rundschau</cite>: “First assert it to be a forgery, and
express indignation at such a calumny upon the
noble dead. Then, when they prove it to be genuine,
refute the errors and foolish ideas which it contains,
but cautiously, and bearing in mind that he was
Emperor and father to the present Emperor.” He
then exclaimed suddenly: “Well, he is gone! Made
off with himself, with the Public Prosecutor at his
heels. Geffcken, I mean, who published it, and who for
the matter of that is no Democrat, but a Particularist.”
I mentioned to him that, during the latter half of the
fifties, Geffcken, under the <i lang="fr" title="pseudonym">nom de plume</i> of “Victor,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>
had, as a friend of Freytag’s and a petty diplomat of
the sniffing and spying order, supplied the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
with Opposition gossip inspired by the Crown Prince
and the Coburg clique; that he was afterwards a
diligent promoter of the Augustenburger’s cause, but
that in 1877, as pointed out in the “Friction” articles,
his place-hunting propensities had been recognised at
Karlsruhe. I then asked whether he had read <i lang="de">Hofrath</i>
Schneider’s posthumous work on the Emperor William,
and added, “he did not appear to be well disposed
towards you.” “Certainly not,” he rejoined; “and he
had good reason for it. He hated me because I had
spoilt a fine business for him. A cousin of mine, a
Bismarck-Bohlen, wanted to marry one of his daughters,
his senior by eleven years, who had driven him crazy
by her coquetry. I pulled him away from her by his
coat-tails. She might have captured a big estate with
him.” I further expressed the opinion that the death of
the Emperor Frederick had saved us from an evil future,
and in particular from English influence on the foreign
policy of Prussia and of the Empire, and from an
estrangement with Russia. “Yes,” he rejoined; “he
was in favour of the Orleans, used his influence for
a daughter of Nemours, was on the side of Poland, of
Denmark, and against the war of 1866,&mdash;always in
favour of what fell in with the views of the English.”</p>

<p>Before lunch on the 29th I begged Rottenburg to ask
the Chief whether our business was now at an end, and
I might consider myself at liberty to return home. I
received no answer, however, although I reminded
Rottenburg of the matter. I spent the day in my room,
in a bad temper, having nothing to do and feeling bored,
and could not go for a walk, as it rained up to dusk.
After dinner reference was again made to the Crown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span>
Prince’s incapacity, of which the Chief treated us to an
exquisite example. He related: “We had at that time a
secret treaty with the St. Petersburg people which now
no longer exists. Under it we were to remain neutral
in case of war breaking out between England and Russia.
On my mentioning the treaty to the Crown Prince he
remarked: ‘Of course England has been informed and
has agreed to it.’” Great laughter, in which the ladies
also joined. The deceased sovereign evidently stood
badly in need of a wax candle to light up his head&mdash;more
so, indeed, than even a certain uncle in
Thuringia. (...)</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 30th of September, Rottenburg
came up to my room about noon, and said: “I have
asked the Chief as to your going home, and he wishes
you to stay at least for a few days longer, so that it
may look like a visit, and not as if you had been specially
summoned here for a purpose. How do you spell <i lang="fr">Commercy</i>?”
I replied: “With two ‘m’s’ and a ‘y.’”
“He will probably question you about their stay there.”
I looked it up, and found that we had arrived at that
place at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 23rd of August, 1870, and left it
at noon on the 24th; that the Chief had had a conference
with the King there, and that Waldersee and
Alvensleben dined with us. Mentioned that to the
Chief at lunch, when by the way, as on the previous
day, he returned my greeting with a “Guten Morgen,
Büschlein”; and when, among the other good things
provided, a basin of peasoup with bacon was served up
to me by the Princess’s orders. This is a favourite dish
of mine, as I happened to let out on Friday in the
course of conversation on various delicacies. The Prince
spoke of the Crown Prince’s inadequate acquaintance
with modern history, as shown by his reference in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span>
diary to the Emperor and Empire as new ideas emanating
from himself and his party. “That was the aspiration
of many a German long before he was born. The
<i lang="de" title="fraternity">Burschenschaft</i> sang and drank to it immediately after
the War of Liberation, and when I went to Göttingen
those were the ideals I carried with me, and if those
students had not fought so shy of duelling and beer
drinking I might have joined them and got myself
involved with them in the subsequent inquiry.” He
then related as further evidence of his political views at
that time his bet with Coffin, whom he, by the way,
knew to be still alive. “As far back as 1848 the idea
of an Emperor was well to the front, but it was unworkable,
principally because people were thinking of
other things at the same time. The beginning of the
Empire already existed in the North German Confederation,
only Bavaria did not want to come in yet, as was
indeed the case in 1870 also, when I had a great deal
of trouble to secure her adhesion. On the other hand,
I had a hard fight with our Most Gracious Master, who
for a long time would not hear of being Emperor. ‘But
does your Majesty wish to remain a neuter for ever?’
I said to him one day. ‘What do you mean by that?’
he said. ‘Why, that hitherto you have been the
Presidency (das Sie bis jetzt <em>das</em> Präsidium sind.’)” If I
rightly understood the Chief at lunch the reason of his
question as to Commercy was that it was there he
recommended the King to confer the Iron Cross upon
the South Germans. “Moltke,” he said, “was entirely
against it, asking whether he himself had any Bavarian
Order.”</p>

<p>At dinner in the evening the guests included
General <a id="TN7"></a>Lesczinsky, who was in uniform, as was also the
Chief. In conversation on a variety of subjects both at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span>
the table and afterwards, L. showed himself to be a
well-informed man of sound views. He was engaged
in the campaigns in Baden, Schleswig-Holstein,
Bohemia and France, and has in addition travelled a
great deal. He is now stationed in Hamburg, whither
he returns to-day. Brauer leaves for home to-night,
starting for Berlin at 11 o’clock.</p>

<p><i>Monday, October 1st.</i>&mdash;At 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Rottenburg came
to my room, and asked me once more the date of our
stay at Commercy. I told him. It actually turns out
that the point in question is, that it was here the Chief
first spoke to the King about giving the Iron Cross
to non-Prussians and to the Bavarians in particular.
In the evening, Rottenburg and I took a long walk past
the Aumühl into Holstein, and arranged to make
similar excursions in other directions, principally
through the Sachsenwald, where there are a number of
good roads, and which is now beginning to take on
autumn tints. Rottenburg is a frank and amiable man,
with whom one is soon on good terms. He is intelligent
and well informed, particularly in social questions. He
has an extensive knowledge of public men, and would
appear in addition to be an excellent worker. He
comes from Danzig, and spent five years in London for
the purpose of study.</p>

<p>After dinner something in the conversation led me
to inform the Prince of Andrae’s letter to me, and of
my meeting with him. He observed that Andrae was
a vain intriguer, and that the story about Stirum was
not true. Moreover, not only Holtz, but the majority
of the others who signed the “Declaration” wrote to
him, Bismarck, separate letters of excuse. The Princess
remarked that Andrae was one of the worst of the
“Deklaranten.” I ascertained at the same time that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span>
her mother was a Gichtelite, and that Below-Hohendorf
was their Grand Lama&mdash;an epithet which
the lady did not use, however. The Chief then read a
little of the book, <cite lang="de">Bismarck unter drei Kaisern</cite>, but after
looking through it for a while he soon laid it aside.
In reply to my question whether there was anything
in it, he said: “Oh, no; a mere hack’s work! Put
together with scissors and paste from the newspapers
and such sources, without much knowledge of the
subject or real coherence.”</p>

<p>During our walk I had mentioned to Rottenburg my
longing for some work to do, and had sought refuge from
my boredom in three volumes of Hallberger’s <cite lang="de">Ueber
Land und Meer</cite>, which I found in my room. He promised
to send me Schmidt’s work on the French Revolution,
but did not do so. In my despair I plucked up
courage and applied to the Chief himself, asking him if he
could not give me something to do, if it were only ciphering,
deciphering or copying, perhaps some matter of no
importance,&mdash;“for my part it may be making out lists or
adding up accounts.” He smiled, and, after reflecting
for a moment, said: “Perhaps I can find some more interesting
occupation for you to-morrow. I will see.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 2nd, took a walk through the
wood to Dassendorf and back, which occupied from 11 to
1 o’clock. The weather was very fine. At lunch I
ascertained from Rottenburg that the Prince wished to
give me a number of letters to look through. When the
Chief got up from table he whispered something to
Rottenburg at the door, whereupon the latter came back
to me and said the Prince was now going upstairs to look
out the papers. In about a quarter of an hour I was summoned
to his study, where he had several large packets
of documents lying before him. He began: “I once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span>
promised you that you should arrange my papers. Here
are some of them&mdash;letters and other things from the
Frankfurt and St. Petersburg period. Here for instance
is the Gerlach correspondence, and there are letters from
Frederick William <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> to me.” He read over one of the
latter to me, and then said: “I think you will find other
matters of interest among them. I myself can no longer
remember exactly all they contain. Take these upstairs
with you, and settle how you are going to arrange them.
I think the chronological order will be the best.” Was
I not delighted? Such confidence! and such a prospect
of fresh information! the fulfilment of a hope that
had almost died. Pleased beyond measure I hurried off
with my burden and immediately set to work on them,
first glancing through the various papers at hazard. The
sifting of this treasure was to commence next morning,
and to be continued on the following days with as little
interruption as possible.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October we were joined at dinner by
the Head Forester, Lange, one of the Prince’s managers
and an expert who was engaged in laying down meadows.
On the 4th the technical controller of one of the Customs
division at Hamburg dined with us. Schweninger arrived
on the 5th. He behaved very nicely, and was, indeed,
almost tender in his manner on my expressing my admiration
of the unquestionable service he had rendered in
restoring the Chancellor’s health. He wished to visit a
patient of his in Mecklenburg, a lady of the nobility,
but on the 6th he was still at Friedrichsruh, where he
was treated by all the members of the family as a friend
of the house. On the 8th we again had the Head
Forester at dinner, as well as a prosperous timber
merchant and coal-mine owner from Westphalia. In
two hours Minister von Bötticher was expected to arrive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span>
from Berlin. At table the Prince related that formerly,
and even since he became Minister, he was sometimes
obliged to dance with Princesses at Court entertainments
until the old gentleman (King William) expressed his
displeasure. He excused himself by saying: “What is
one to do, your Majesty, when Princesses command?”
The Princesses were accordingly informed of the prohibition.
Keudell was also passionately fond of dancing
formerly, and Radowitz too, but the King also broke the
latter of this habit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Addendum.</span>&mdash;Yesterday the Chancellor once more
returned to the subject of King William’s anxiety in
1866 to utilise his victories in a different way to what
he (Bismarck) advised. “His mind was set on Northern
Bohemia, half of Saxony, half of Hanover, Ansbach and
Bayreuth, &amp;c., and it was difficult to get the idea out
of his head.” At lunch to-day I told the Chief (in
English on account of the servants) that I expected to
finish my work in two or three days, and to return the
papers to him in linen envelopes, arranged according to
the years. He replied (also in English): “Then you
have lost no time, seeing what a quantity of them there
were. But I have also a number of others for you. The
work is not yet over, as there is a lot more there, more
recent and perhaps more interesting for you. Have you
found anything of importance among the first batch?”
I said I had. He called attention to the contrast between
Gerlach and Manteuffel, the Minister, which was evident
from their letters. He also mentioned Niebuhr, of whom
he remarked: “It is with him as with many pious
people of his sort: he has no tact, regards himself as the
envoy of an anointed King, and as his representative
considers himself to be also anointed.”</p>

<p>On the 9th of October I had been a fortnight at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span>
Friedrichsruh, and on the 10th the last envelope would
be filled, but other important work intervened unexpectedly.
Two documents arrived from the Ministry of
the Household, a short and a long war diary of the Crown
Prince, afterwards Emperor Frederick, both written in
his own hand, the first presumably an extract, or
perhaps the original of the harmless part of the latter,
the second obviously written for the most part after the
war, and with many additions. Both are to be speedily
examined, and, as Rottenburg informed me on bringing
me the documents, I was to do part of the work,
examining the latter portion of the first of the two
manuscripts, while the Chief dealt with the earlier
portion and he (Rottenburg) with the second. I also
assisted Rottenburg afterwards, as the papers had to be
sent back to Berlin in two days. The diary in the
<cite lang="de">Deutsche Rundschau</cite> is not from the shorter version,
but from the far more comprehensive one of the
Ministry of the Household, the interpolations of which
are in great part of a political nature, and are often
highly characteristic, although deficient in real statesmanship.
The writer is in every respect mediocre and
superficial, no talent and no character, although he is
thoroughly at home in fault-finding and abuse. We
collected and noted down in our section some particularly
fine specimens of his manner of thought, and
of these a small selection may be here given. They
do not include the finest of all, which I had to leave to
Rottenburg or for the Chief, who came into our bureau
(at 11 o’clock at night) while we were making the
extracts, and was pleased to find that I was so diligent
in my efforts to be of use. On the 4th of January the
author of the interpolated diary had read “with great
satisfaction” the reflections upon the new year published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span>
by the <cite lang="de">Volkszeitung</cite>, and was “horrified” that the
Minister of War had forbidden the circulation of the
paper. On the 2nd of January an eulogy of the Queen
of England, “who stands up for us Germans at every
opportunity, knows very well what are the issues
involved, and understands German affairs.” On the 8th
of January he notes Odo Russell’s satisfaction at
Bismarck’s having yielded in the matter of the English
coal ships (a matter which <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> had much at heart).&mdash;On
the 11th of January Prince Luitpold’s “unworthy”
proposal respecting the military oath of allegiance of
the Bavarians, had, like Bismarck’s irritability, greatly
worried his Majesty.&mdash;January 17th. Bismarck, speaking
to Schleinitz in the antechamber, had “peevishly”
exclaimed that he could not conceive why there should
be a joint conference of the Chancellor of the Confederation
and the Minister of the Household in
presence of the King. Then a very detailed account of
the interview respecting the Emperor and Empire at the
Prefecture. On that occasion the King was very excited
and vehement, and the Crown Prince was afterwards so
unwell that he had to take medicine.&mdash;February 1st.
Interesting addition respecting Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein,
“who, like myself (the Crown Prince) regrets
the manner in which the Empire has been brought into
existence, &amp;c.”&mdash;February 14th. A somewhat lengthy
account (an addition) of an interview between the
Crown Prince and Bonnechose.&mdash;16th. Conversation
with Russell on the consequences of English neutrality.
(In another passage apprehensions for beloved England,
owing to Bismarck’s leaning towards Russia and the
United States). 22nd. Doubtless an interpolation of
a much later date. That “after the peace our next
task must be the solution of the social question.” It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span>
certain that the good gentleman with his narrow views
and small brain never thought of that subject until
Bismarck found time to take the matter in hand, and
discovered ways and means for dealing with the evil
which would never have occurred to his Royal Highness
and his <cite lang="de">Volkszeitung</cite>.&mdash;26th. Conversation with
Père Hyacinthe on the Catholic Church (and also on
Döllinger). As was to be expected, the Crown Prince
has high praise for that superficial and sentimental
individual, and feels that his words have actually given
him a sense of exaltation and a feeling of deep peace.&mdash;March
10th (pp. 351, 352 of the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>). Lengthy statement
of political views, of which extracts have appeared in
the <cite lang="de">Deutsche Rundschau</cite>. The interpolated diary goes
as far as the 17th of July, 1871, at Munich, and then
a few pages follow respecting his stay in England and
at Wilhelmshöhe.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October his Excellency von Bötticher
appeared at lunch. Intelligent, practical looking face,
tall figure, and a moustache with a tuft trimmed after
the fashion of Napoleon. On going to the chimney
piece for a light for his cigar brings me one also. The
Chief, who as usual occupied himself at lunch with
reading through and signing official documents, looking
up from a paper, suddenly remarked: “‘<i lang="de" title="constantly">Unentwegt</i>,’
Busch can’t bear that word.” The Minister looked at
me and smiled. “That is so,” I said, “and I consider
‘<i lang="de" title="in this regard">diesbezüglich</i>’ still more abominable. The former has
come to us from Switzerland, and the latter from
Vienna.” The Chief then sang the praises of the
herring to Bötticher also, mentioning that he eats it
regularly, and adding some remarks on other means of
promoting health, as, for instance, that here when the
weather is favourable he rides or walks for two or even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span>
three hours daily, his quantum in the latter case being
five thousand paces, and not infrequently more.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October the documents which the
Chief had handed over to me to arrange had all been
read through, put into chronological order, and numbered
consecutively in red pencil from 1 to 308. These were
packed in eight large envelopes, each docketed with the
year and the dates and numbers of the first and last
documents contained in them. Further particulars of
the contents, which I offered to give, were declined by
the Prince as superfluous. These papers consisted for
the most part of letters, the remainder being reports,
memoranda, drafts, and telegrams. The following is
a survey of the contents.</p>

<p>First Envelope. The year 1851. (Also includes a
letter from Prince Charles, dated March 21st, 1848.)
Nos. 1 to 29. They begin with the 5th of June and end
with the 24th of December, and consist in great part of
letters from the Minister and General Manteuffel, from
R. Quehl, from Bismarck to Manteuffel, and from General
L. von Gerlach. Contents of the latter: That of the
23rd of November, against the new Hamburg Constitution,
Senator Hudtwalker’s mission, a scheme for giving
the Estates a position side by side with Constitutionalism.
That of the 4th of December, again on the
Hamburg Constitution. That of the 20th of December,
considerations on Bonapartism, after the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>,
request for an expression of opinion on the situation,
with the hope that their views coincide.</p>

<p>Second Envelope. 1852. Nos. 30 to 85. Begins
with the 5th of January and ends with the 30th of
December. Principally letters from General Gerlach and
Minister Manteuffel, R. Quehl, King Frederick William,
a rescript by that sovereign, four almost illegible notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span>
from the Prince of Prussia, and, finally, a communication
from Bismarck to Gerlach, dated the 5th of January,
reporting on the change of Ministers in Nassau, the
question of the fleet, the relations of Austria to France,
and possible anti-Prussian schemes of Schwarzenberg,
the views of the English Chargé d’Affaires, Edwardes, on
Bonapartism. The first letter from the King begins with
the words: “I would remind you, dearest Bismarck
(theuerster Bismarck), that I reckon upon you and your
assistance in the approaching debates in the Second
Chamber respecting the shape to be given to the First
Chamber.” Further on there is a reference to “the low
intrigues of the conscious or unconscious coalition of
scabby sheep on the Right and stinking goats on the Left
to defeat the Royal intentions.” “A sad sight, and in
any circumstances sufficient to make one tear his hair,
but on the field of the dearly-purchased, lie-producing
machine of French Constitutionalism! (<span lang="de">Ein trauriger
Anblick, unter allen Verhältnissen zum Haare Ausraufen,
aber auf dem Felde der theuer angeschafften Lügenmaschine
des französischen Constitutionalismus</span>).” The rescript
(of the 3rd of June) appoints Bismarck Chargé d’Affaires
in Vienna, and summons him to Berlin to receive
instructions. The second royal letter (of the 5th of
June) introduces him to the Emperor Francis Joseph
and says, <i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>: “I am pleased that your Majesty
will be able to make the acquaintance of a man who is
here honoured by many and hated by others, on account
of his chivalrous loyalty and his irreconcilable opposition
to revolution in every form. He is my friend and loyal
servant, and comes to your Majesty with the fresh and
lively impress of my principles, of my line of action, of
my will, and, I may add, of my love for Austria. If it be
deemed worth while, he can inform your Majesty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span>
your Majesty’s advisers on various matters as I believe
few are capable of doing, and if misunderstandings of an
old date have not struck too deep a root, which God in
His mercy forbid, his brief official sojourn in Vienna
will truly be rich in blessings. Herr von Bismarck comes
from Frankfurt, where what the middle States, with
their leaning towards a Rhenish Confederation (die
rheinbundschwangeren Mittelstaaten) call the weak
P. of P. (Query&mdash;the weak points of Prussia) has
always elicited a powerful echo and has frequently made
recruits. He has watched all this and whatever was
going on there with a sharp and penetrating eye. I
have commanded him to answer every question that
may be addressed to him by your Majesty and
your Ministers as if I myself had addressed them to
him. If your Majesty should be pleased to ask for
an explanation of my views and my action in the
matter of the Hessian Constitution, I feel sure that
the course taken by me, even if it should not perhaps
have the good fortune to meet with your approval,
will at least secure your respect. The presence of
the beloved and glorious Emperor Nicholas has
been to me a real encouragement, and a certain confirmation
of the strong hope that your Majesty and myself
are at one in the truth that our triple, unswervingly
loyal and active union can alone save Europe and the
froward, yet so beloved, German Fatherland from the
present crisis, fills me with gratitude to God, and
increases my old and faithful affection for your Majesty.
Do you also, my dearest Emperor, preserve for me your
love from the days at Tegernsee, and confirm your confidence
and your weighty and powerful friendship to me
which are so indispensable to the common Fatherland.
From the bottom of my heart I commend myself to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>
friendship as your Imperial Majesty’s true and most
cordially devoted Uncle, Brother and Friend.” Gerlach’s
letter to Bismarck of the 9th of March condemns the
language used by B. in an interview with the King
respecting the First Chamber, and in particular that he
had not pointed out how his Majesty, “through the
attitude which he had adopted, had estranged the
nobility, disorganised the parties, and shaken the position
of the Ministry.”&mdash;15th April. An inquiry at the
instance of the King concerning the truth of the rumour
that Prince Frederick of Baden was thinking of becoming
a Catholic. Then an announcement that Nesselrode was
coming to Berlin and that Bismarck was to be introduced
to him. G. praises the excellent report on the situation
in Bismarck’s letter to Manteuffel on the representation
of the Confederacy in the Danish negotiations. He
laments the death of Schwarzenberg, and expects
nothing better from Bach and Buol. Reports that
Rochow has arrived with very good news; regrets that
England and Austria should fraternise with Bonapartism
and that the Emperor Nicholas should have also allowed
himself to be taken in by its anti-Constitutionalism.
According to an enclosure of the 21st of April, the
rumour respecting Prince Frederick was unfounded.&mdash;12th
April. Telegram: “There is no hurry with the
answer in the (Baden) religious affair.”&mdash;18th April.
Bismarck was to come to the debate on the First
Chamber. The King counted upon his doing so. “We
have now assembled the publicans and sinners, ...
and the speeches in the Chamber will soon begin again.”&mdash;9th
May. Gerlach agrees with what Bismarck had said
on the debates in the Chamber; reports that the King was
greatly incensed at Arnim’s speech, and that he doubtless
recognises that “his whole salvation lies in the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span>
of the Junker party.” He does not anticipate that all
will go well in Berlin, although the Emperor of Russia
remains there for twelve days, and Francis Joseph has
ordered a Prussian Grenadier uniform.&mdash;17th May.
Gerlach shares Bismarck’s indignation at a newspaper
article which was probably inspired by Manteuffel;
considers M. to be an honest man, but he has had a
singular political past, and cannot come to a good end,
unless he sends Quehl about his business. Examples
of his inconsistency. “M. has a yearning towards
Bonapartism,” “which, after all, has no future.” All is
going well with the Emperor and Empress of Russia,
“but when they see these things one cannot expect
them to entertain much respect for our policy.” Alludes
further on to the Zollverein and the opening of direct
negotiations for a commercial treaty with Austria; and
concludes with a suggestion that Bismarck should come
to Berlin, remaining there while the Chamber was
sitting and until the departure of the Russians, “in
order that one might consider what should and what
could be done.”&mdash;May 19th. Gerlach reports that
Manteuffel, in speaking to him, had defended Quehl,
and declared that he would rather resign than part with
him. Quehl asserts that he has received a very reassuring
letter from Bismarck. Manteuffel is considered
indispensable, and so the only course would be to take
Westphalen, who deserves it “for sticking to a principle
and for his high-mindedness.” His fall would signify a
renunciation of the principle of restoring vitality to the
Estates as against Constitutionalism. A marked opposition
was now developing between Absolutism and the
liberty of the Estates, between the atheistic and the
Christian State, and the Manteuffels inclined towards
Absolutism and political atheism.&mdash;May 29th. Under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>
instructions from the King Gerlach calls attention to
the circulation of Dulong’s pamphlet, “Der Tag ist
angebrochen,” and observes that his Majesty wishes
action to be taken against this state of things in the
press.&mdash;July 21st. Gerlach censures Wagner’s attitude
towards Manteuffel, whose position, it is true, is scarcely
tenable “unless he decides to enter into alliances with
respectable people.” G. regards the future with apprehension,
“not that a revolutionary Parliament is now
probable, but owing to fear of the rising bureaucracy
with its measures of police and its weakness in the days
of trial,” days which must come, as Bonaparte will be driven
into action abroad by the failure of his internal policy.
Bismarck ought to “carry on a positive federal policy” in
order that the others should not take the wind out of
Prussia’s sails. After the probable victory in the matter
of the Zollverein, our dull-witted opponents will
presumably lack material for fresh attacks. We should
then assume the offensive.&mdash;July 23rd. Gerlach begs
Bismarck to take up the question of the Hamburg
Constitution (against the proposed reform of the new
Constitution). Further on, the news that Gerlach has
written to Manteuffel that he should not allow himself
to be governed by the Conservative party but that he
should show himself their master, “and once under the
yoke, govern with them.”&mdash;July 26th. The Conservatives
of Hamburg have begun to move and are anxiously
awaiting the note of the Federal Diet; and Bismarck
should meet this desire. “The position of affairs in
Berlin is an extraordinary one.” Gerlach spoke very
strongly to the Premier but without any hope of
success. Manteuffel “must be retained at all costs, as
his probable successors are simply a terror.” Gerlach’s
brother in Magdeburg wishes to visit Bismarck at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span>
Frankfurt.&mdash;July 29th. Gerlach was highly pleased at
Bismarck’s letter of justification, and communicated its
contents to the King, who has not entertained the
suspicion therein mentioned. The Zollverein business
promises to go well. In dealing with it Austria has
“behaved in a miserably intriguing fashion. What a
pitiful policy in presence of the revolution, and of the
sovereignty of the people, of which Bonaparte is the
incarnation! On a smaller scale, however, our own
policy is just the same.” In connection with the
Hamburg affair, Bismarck should publish the Notes and
Rescripts of the Confederacy to the Senate by an indiscretion.
“This, which has hitherto been a mild request
on my part, is now a strong expression of the King’s
desire.”&mdash;August 3rd. Renewed request that Bismarck
should take up the cause of the Hamburg Conservatives.
It has now come to such a pass with Manteuffel that no
one trusts him, and he trusts nobody. If this mistrust
is to be removed, the Ministry must be supported in
every possible way.&mdash;October 8th. Gerlach complains
of Manteuffel and Wagner, and at the instance of the
King urges intervention in the Hamburg affair. Hübbe,
the leader of the Conservative party there, has been to
see him and the King.&mdash;November 13th. Gerlach is of
opinion that the internal situation is good, if Bismarck
“will remain at his post as sentinel on the Rhine (not
become Minister?) and keep a sharp eye on the inception
and development of the Rhenish Confederation.” If he
comes to the Chambers he should get elected to the
First “where there is a lack of talent.” G. thinks him
better off with Rechberg as a colleague rather than
Hübener, because the former is opposed to Bonapartism,
while the latter is in favour of it. There is nothing to
be done in Hamburg except to procrastinate. The idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span>
of revising the draft prepared by the nine deputies,
instead of the old existing Constitution, is absurd.</p>

<p>Third Envelope. 1853. Begins with the 2nd of
January and ends with the 14th of December. The
first is a letter from Frederick William to Manteuffel on
the Danish detachment in the Holstein federal contingent.
It says: “In my opinion this should not be
tolerated by the German Confederacy if it still retains a
spark of honour. We must speak at Frankfurt like
honourable Germans, even if they through their ingrained
dishonesty will not listen to us. Germany, however,
shall and will hear us. If the particulars given by the
newspapers should be confirmed, I authorise you to send
this little note, in the original, to Bismarck, and to
consult details with him.” The following letters are
chiefly from Gerlach, Minister Manteuffel, and the Prince
of Prussia, and include a further communication from
King Frederick William to Bismarck, dated the 12th of
September: “My dearest Bismarck, a misunderstanding
prevails in my brother William’s circles, a solution of
which is necessary to the satisfaction of everybody concerned.
At Doberan I received a letter from him, in
which he loudly laments Manteuffel’s now certain retirement,
which he rightly characterises as a calamity. I
asked William for a solution of this riddle, as, of course,
everything had been settled three weeks ago, and my
perseverance had been crowned with success. He wrote
to me in reply about a week since, that he was glad of
this, but you, my good Bismarck, had received a letter
from Putbus, from the contents of which you, like himself,
could draw no other conclusion. From Sans-souci
I asked him who was the writer of this letter. He told
me Gerlach (Polte); to-day I questioned Gerlach, and
he assures me most positively that he has written nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span>
of the kind to you from Putbus. Here you have the
puzzle Schlemassl, in the German-Jewish dialect.
Unravel it for me and William as soon as possible.
Let your pen be guided by the purest truth.”
Bismarck replied to this that Gerlach had written
him that he wished to induce Manteuffel to remain, as
it appeared impossible to replace him. He had only
received this letter however on the 17th or 18th of
August, at Ostend. The following letters from Gerlach
are worth mentioning. January 8th. (Report of a conversation
which Gerlach has had with Ex-Minister v. d.
Decken on constitutional changes in Hanover, in which
the King of Prussia should assist. The letter desires
Bismarck to take up this matter, but first of all to write
and give his opinion.) Another of the 28th of January.
(For the present Bismarck is not to trouble himself about
the Hanoverian affair. Opinion of Prokesch. Gerlach
would like to have Bismarck in Berlin, as he fears grave
crises, and, according to him, the people should be given
clearly to understand that Bonapartism is our worst foe....
Bonaparte will direct his lust of conquest against
Spain.) Finally, Gerlach’s letters on his conflict with
Manteuffel. This conflict was clearly indicated in the
letter of the 23rd of February, in which it is stated,
<i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>, that Manteuffel had through Quehl taken a
turn downwards, because he doubted the truth of what
came to him from above; he wants to see the Conservative
party destroyed, and he allows himself to be
tempted by Quehl into secret opposition to Westphalen’s
measures.</p>

<p>Fourth Envelope. First half of the year 1854.
Begins with an undated letter from Gerlach, probably
written in January; it is followed by one from Manteuffel
dated the 4th of January, while the remainder are mostly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span>
letters from the latter to Gerlach, together with reports
by Bismarck, and finally, two letters of Seckendorff’s
from Stuttgart, the second of which is dated the 27th of
June. The following are of special interest. A note of
the 17th of March, from the Prince of Prussia, asking
Bismarck for information on the Eastern Question, and
the reply thereto, a rather lengthy draft by Bismarck;
then his report as to an interview which he had with the
Prince at Baden, with the result that the latter yields to
the royal will, though opposed to his own convictions; a
letter from Bismarck to Gerlach on the Bamberg results;
an exhaustive report by Bismarck on Buol’s view of the
Eastern Question, which the former considers to be
correct&mdash;doubtless addressed to Manteuffel; another
report to the latter on the Bamberg Governments,
Bismarck wanting apparently to keep them in check,
and also respecting Bunsen and Gagern.</p>

<p>Fifth Envelope. Second half of the year 1854.
Begins with a letter of the 1st of July from Gerlach
(who finds that Manteuffel is now taking a proper
course) and ends with a letter of the 31st of December.
The intervening papers include among other things a
confidential report by Bismarck to Manteuffel on the
abstention of Würtemberg from the existing agreement
between the other Governments in favour of the
alliance of April 20th; letters from Manteuffel and
Gerlach; an (autograph) memorandum by Bismarck on
the attitude of the Bamberg people, and of Buol
towards Prussia. It says: “We cannot consent to an
aggrandisement of Austria, because the importance of
Prussia in respect of physical force would be approximated
thereby to that of Bavaria. The Western Powers
will want to restore Poland, which would be less against
the interests of Austria than against those of Prussia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span>
and Russia.” The remaining papers include letters from
Alvensleben, Bunsen, Pückler, Wolzogen and Schulenburg.</p>

<p>Sixth Envelope. The year 1855, but only from the
2nd of January to the 14th of August. Then come
breaks in the correspondence up to November 1858.
Chiefly letters from Gerlach and Manteuffel. Also a
letter from Frederick William to King John of Saxony
(dated 18th January); five or six from Savigny (in one
of which he laments that Prussia has missed an
excellent opportunity of placing herself at the head of
Germany) and from Schulenburg, &amp;c. There is a
characteristic letter from Gerlach, dated the 4th of
January, in which he writes: “I believe that we should
be in agreement if you were here, that is to say, as to
the measures to be taken, if not also as to principles&mdash;for
I hold to the Holy Scriptures, which teach that we
must not do evil in order that good may come of it,
because those who act in that way are very properly
damned. Now to coquet with Bonapartism and
Liberalism is to do evil, and moreover, to my thinking,
it is unwise in the present case. This you forget (a
mistake into which every one falls who has been away
from here for some time).... How can you go on
finessing indirectly with such an utterly unprincipled
and untrustworthy Minister, who is involuntarily lured
into the wrong path, and with a master whose peculiarities,
to put it mildly, defy calculation? Just remember
that F. D. (Fra Diavolo, pseudonym for Manteuffel) is
a Bonapartist on principle; think of his behaviour in
connection with the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, and of what Quehl wrote
under his patronage&mdash;and if you want to know something
new I can tell you that he has now written to Werther
expressing the foolish opinion that if one wanted to be
useful to Russia the way would be to adhere to the
treaty of the 2nd of December in order to have a voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>
in the negotiations; indeed I believe that F. D. has
actually advised the King to adhere to the treaty of
the 2nd of December, that is to say, with modifications,
these, according to the way in which things
are done here, being of the nature of reservations which
our adversaries would afterwards ignore, without paying
any attention to us in the event of their non-observance.
Our policy moves along a very narrow path, upon a
tight rope, and so far one may say that it has maintained
its equilibrium, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, it has not fallen into the abyss on
either side, yet its course remains anything but
secure.... The King, and you also, appear to attribute
an exaggerated importance to our participation in the
conferences. What good is this gloriole to us, as we can
turn it to no account so long as Austria (as is clear from
Gortschakoff’s reports) is frightened into hobbling after
the Western Powers? Shall we hobble with her, or
shall we join England and France in the chorus against
Russia, or shall we alone take Russia’s part, a course
that would require more courage and skill than can be expected
of our deaf and invalid envoy in Vienna. I consider
it more dignified, effective, and successful for us to take
up an entirely independent attitude towards Austria
and the Western Powers. We have met with a rebuff
in Paris and London. (The <i lang="de">züffliche</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Usedom and his
Radical wife ought never to have been sent there; but
that has now been done, however.) Austria has treated
us with consistent perfidy. We are, therefore, released
from all ties. France, with 300,000 men beyond her
frontiers, and England, without an army, will not begin
war with us. I do not fear Austria in the least, first
because she fears us, while, in addition to that, she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span>
not a man to spare. It would be mere madness
to irritate us, should she really want to pick a
quarrel with Russia. She now demands with her usual
impudence and recklessness that 100,000 men be
raised as soon as possible, under the military convention
which Hesse has concluded with her. (I
shudder at the thought of the foolish and puerile proceedings
of April of last year.) To this the reply is
curt and bold; there is a firm conviction, based on assurances
as well as information received, that the
Emperor of Russia has no idea of attacking Austria,
either on her own territories or in the Principalities, so
that no <i lang="la" title="case in which an alliance comes into operation">casus fœderis</i> arises either for Prussia or for
the Germanic Confederation. The Prussian army is
ready for war, and can be brought into a still greater
state of readiness. It is true that Austria has provoked
Russia by the treaty concluded on the 2nd of December
without the concurrence of Prussia and the Bund, but
one is convinced that Russia nevertheless contemplates
no attack. I certainly believed that, in face of this
declaration on the part of Prussia, Austria would hardly
secure her two-thirds majority, and, indeed, that she
would probably not even try to force the matter through.
Unquestionably, nothing can be done very speedily
now. If, however, the negotiations in Vienna take such
a turn that their success may be anticipated, they will come
to us, and not ignore our 300,000 men. That would be
impossible, even now, if all confidence, as well as all
sense of fear, had not been destroyed by swaying, not
merely to and fro, as frequently happens, but in three
different directions, which is of rarer occurrence. I am
very anxious that you should come here, if only for
a few days, in order to discuss matters.... Do, please,
write soon, and criticise this my letter. Write also, if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span>
can possibly be managed, that you are coming.... I yearn
for political death. A man who has grown old and
blunt and peevish is no longer the right man to
wriggle his way through between such a singular master
(for whom, all the same, I have an affection of forty
years’ standing) and such a premier. Indeed, my bodily
conformation is a symbolic warning against doing anything
of the kind.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Seventh Envelope. Documents of the period extending
from the 7th of November, 1858, to the 21st
of June, 1861, chiefly letters from Minister Schleinitz
to Bismarck, and from the latter to the former from St.
Petersburg, including a very long one of the 12th of May,
1859, in which B. deals with the improvement of Prussia’s
position in Germany as opposed to Austria, indicating
ways and means of bringing it about.... Then a very
interesting communication, dated the 14th of May, from
Bismarck to Alvensleben, which was accompanied by a copy
of the letter of the 12th. According to this, the latter was
really intended for the then Minister President, the
Prince of Hohenzollern, yet the writer is “in the end in
a state of doubt as to how his Highness is in his heart
likely to regard this matter.” The letter to Alvensleben
then goes on to say: “I believe too that Schleinitz will
not withhold my letter from <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> the Regent, although
I scarcely hope that it will be received with favour there.
If you are so disposed and have an opportunity of
kindling in the Prince a spark of royal ambition in this
sense, I beg of you to make use of the contents of the
enclosure, as if I had written to you privately on the
same subjects upon which I wrote to Schleinitz. Of
course, the only difference is in the head and tail of it,
and to whether in your case the title of Excellency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span>
already connotes externally the excellences of the inward
man. There is almost always an element of mistrust
and discontent when I write to Schleinitz, sending you
at the same time a copy of my letter, and the Prince
allows it to leak out.” On the 29th of May, 1859,
Bismarck gives his Minister a serio-comic description of
the petty proceedings of the envoys of the German
Middle States at St. Petersburg, with whom Gortschakoff
has little intercourse, and who worry the more fortunate
Prussian representative in their efforts to obtain some
material to satisfy their love of gossip. The Hanoverian,
Münster, is particularly active and importunate. The
Saxon, Könneritz, manifests the warmest enthusiasm for
Prussia, abuses Beust and Austria, and “speaks as if he
were serving under a Carlowitz Ministry; but we have
an old and good proverb<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that teaches us never to trust
a Saxon from Meissen. Montgelas is most profoundly
depressed at the fall in the value of Austrian securities,
and seems to think, strangely enough, that the remedy
to this evil lies in bringing about a general war.”
Schleinitz’s letters are almost always full of praise and
thanks for Bismarck’s excellent reports. Yet on one
occasion (June 24) he acknowledges that many insinuations
against him personally, and against his official
conduct have reached Berlin. But he adds: “With
your reports in my hand I have, however, succeeded in
effectually repelling them;” and continues: “if, nevertheless,
I take the liberty of requesting you to conform
as far as possible to the views of your Government in
your non-official conversations and relations, that request
is perhaps entirely superfluous, but I am induced to make
it by a desire to prevent your laying yourself open in
any direction to the attacks of opponents.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span></p>
<p>Eighth Envelope. Undated letters and other documents,
as well as some of uncertain date.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 12th of October, we were joined first
at lunch and then again at dinner by a plump lady in
black silk, a Frau von Patkowski from East Prussia, a
daughter of Kaiserlingk, an old friend of the Chief’s. I
begged the Prince’s permission to absent myself for three
days, and took leave of him and of the ladies of the
house.</p>

<p>I started for Berlin at 12.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on Saturday, the
13th. On my going down to his bureau to see Rottenburg,
who wished to accompany me to the train, I met
the Chief in the antechamber. He said, smiling, “It is
lucky that I have met you before you leave. Frau von
Patkowski is travelling with you, so please take care not
to lay siege to the pretty plump little lady on the way!”
“Those times are over, Serene Highness, and besides, she
travels first class and I second.” “Well, in that case she
will no doubt be safe.” I expressed a hope that during
my absence he would have good weather, as it is necessary
for his health, so that he may get his walks and
rides. “I do what I can,” he said, “to keep illness at
a distance, but it will come all the same, and probably
soon. It will be a sudden break down, just as I stand.”
Thanks be to God, his appearance in no way justified
such a foreboding, as he proceeded to the station with
the lady on his arm, walking erect and the very picture
of health.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 17th October, at 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, I
again left Berlin for Friedrichsruh.</p>

<p>I had previously been accustomed every evening
after dinner to spend some time romping in the next
room with the three little Rantzaus. When I asked
their mother at lunch how the boys were, she asked me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span>
not to let them have their usual game to-day as a
punishment, the two elder lads having been rude and
insolent to their governess in the morning. The Prince
said they must be whipped for that. The Countess
replied that she had deprived them of their bath and
slapped them on the cheek for it. He rejoined, however,
“That is not enough for such naughtiness. They
ought to be well whipped.” He then related how he
had chastised Herbert and Bill on one occasion, when
they took some hazel nuts and then ran away from the
ranger. “It was not on account of the nuts, but because
they had obliged the old man to run after them through
bush and briar until I caught them and gave them a
good trouncing, at which the ranger seemed to be greatly
surprised.” I inquired of him whether governesses and
other persons entrusted with the education of princes
were at liberty to chastise them when they were
naughty, or whether they had to tell the parents, who
decided as to their punishment. He answered the first
part of my question in the affirmative, and went on to
say that the governess of the Emperor William <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> said
as she was administering physical chastisement to him
on one occasion: “Believe me, Royal Highness, that it
hurts me as much as it does you to do this.” “Ah!”
exclaimed the little Prince, “and does it hurt you in
the same place?” Everybody laughed heartily at the
queer form taken by the boy’s curiosity. As we rose
from table and Lindau was taking leave before returning
home, the Prince asked me: “Are you going to your
room now?” “Yes, Serene Highness.” “I will send
for you there. I have something I should like to show
you.” In about a quarter of an hour I was summoned
to the Prince’s study, where the Chief handed me a
large packet of letters. “These are from the old Emperor,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>
he said, and then read me some passages from
them. He wished to have them arranged like the
former papers. “Again in mere chronological order,
according to the dates.” He asked: “But will not that
be too much for you?” I replied with an emphatic
negative. I was there for that purpose, and it was a
pleasure to me to serve him, and at the same time to
have something to read and take with me for my information.
He continued: “And here, too, is one from
old Bodelschwingh-Schwindelbod. And there are others
(pointing to a second packet), the correspondence with
Andrassy, for instance, in the summer of 1879. You
will find information enough there.” He took up the
third pile. “These are from the Emperor Frederick when
he was Crown Prince, and also one from <em>her</em> from the
villa Zivio.” He was about to return them to the drawer
of his writing-table, but I begged him to let me have
them also. He said smiling, “But, Büschlein, haven’t
you already enough?”&mdash;“It will be better for me to
have everything there is at once, so that I may have a
general idea of all the documents and arrange them more
rapidly.”&mdash;“But there are still plenty more, and that
pile is already heavy enough to carry!” I took all
he had by him, however, and carried them upstairs in
order to begin my inspection of them next morning.
But I could not rest until I had read through some of
them as specimens in the afternoon. For example, a
long letter from the Crown Princess, dated San Remo,
the 22nd of November, 1887, giving the Chancellor particulars
of her consort’s illness and of the doctors; and
also Bodelschwingh’s communication, on the top of which
the Chief had written in pencil “Old hypocrite.” Then
before dinner a further walk with Rottenburg in the
wood where it is cut through by the road leading to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span>
Möhnsen. Lively conversation on a variety of matters
serious and amusing, as for instance on Darwin and
the high esteem in which he is held by the Chief.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of Thursday, October 18th, I
began to assort the papers. The numbering and packing
away in envelopes was to follow later, after a thorough
inspection of the whole lot. Out of doors a beautiful
autumn day, the sun, in a blue sky, casting high lights
on the stems and branches of the trees in the wood.
During lunch, at which Schweninger again joined us, I
handed the Chief the Crown Prince’s letter introducing
Geffcken to him and his answer justifying his refusal by
a description of Geffcken’s character. I had found this
among the papers on the previous day. He was pleased
at the discovery, and the letters were handed to Rottenburg
to be copied and used. Immediately afterwards
Schweinitz, our Ambassador at St. Petersburg, arrived&mdash;a
grey-headed, portly gentleman with a moustache, who
speaks little and in a low voice. We were joined at
dinner, in addition to Schweinitz, by a big-bearded
gentleman in a shooting jacket. This was Major von
Goldammer of Frankfurt, the sportsman who recently&mdash;to
the great regret of the head forester&mdash;shot the stag
with fourteen antlers that had broken out from the Chief’s
preserves on to the shooting which he had rented.
“If it had only been Count Herbert!” Bleichröder is
to present his respects to-morrow.</p>

<p>On Saturday I spent the whole forenoon and two
hours after lunch in arranging the papers in order of
date. Bleichröder and his Jewish-looking Secretary took
lunch with us. The banker related anecdotes of Amschel
Rothschild and Saphir, and spoke of Lehndorff’s businesses.
At table I observed that since 1871 Bleichröder,
whom I saw at dinner at Versailles, had hardly altered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span>
in the least. “Not in his person” rejoined the Chief,
“but very considerably in his fortune.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 21st of October, I began to examine
and number the papers, which were now in chronological
order, whereby I found that a good deal of
rearrangement was necessary. Here follow some particulars.</p>

<p>The documents begin with a letter dated Oct. 19,
1862, from Bismarck to King William. Then follows a
short letter from the Crown Prince to the Minister,
dated Nov. 21, in which he says: “I trust that, as you
express it to me, success may, in the present difficult
phase of the constitutional life of our country, attend
your efforts to bring about what you yourself describe
as the urgent and necessary understanding with the
representatives of the nation. I am following the
course of affairs with the greatest interest,” and so on.
Letter from Bismarck to the King, in which Eulenburg
and Selchow are proposed as Ministers. (I shall not
quote unimportant letters from the King and the Crown
Prince, nor in future any matters of only slight interest.)
A letter from Bismarck to the King, dated 20th
February, 1863, on the convention with Russia. Goltz
communicated it to Napoleon, but without the secret
article, with which he himself was not acquainted.
(Probably the article by which Prussia was bound
eventually to render assistance against the Polish
rebellion.) The Minister wrote: “As matters stand in
Poland we shall hardly be called upon for active co-operation
there. By means of the convention we have,
therefore, the advantage of securing at a cheap rate for
the future the gratitude of the Emperor Alexander and
the sympathies of the Russians.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Writing to Bismarck, from Stettin, on the 30th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>
June, 1863, the Crown Prince says: “I see from your
letter of the 10th instant that at his Majesty’s
command you have omitted to communicate officially
to the Ministry of State my protest respecting the
rescript, restricting the liberty of the press, which I sent
to you from Graudenz on the 8th of June. I can easily
understand that the opportunity of treating as a personal
matter an incident which, as you yourself have
acknowledged, might, in its consequences, acquire widespread
significance, was not unwelcome to you. It
would serve no purpose for me to insist upon that
communication being made, as I am justified in inferring
from your own words that it will have been done unofficially.
It is necessary for me, however, to speak
plainly to you respecting the alternative which you
place before me, namely, to lighten or to render more
difficult the task which the Ministry has undertaken. I
cannot lighten that task, as I find myself opposed to it
in principle. A loyal administration of the laws and of
the Constitution, respect and good will towards an easily
led, intelligent and capable people&mdash;these are the
principles which, in my opinion, should guide every
Government in the treatment of the country. I cannot
bring the policy which finds expression in the ordinance
of the first of June into harmony with these principles.
It is true you seek to prove to me the constitutional
character of that rescript, and you assure me that you
and your colleagues remember your oath. I think,
however, that the Government requires a stronger basis
than very dubious interpretations which do not appeal to
the sound common sense of the people. You yourself
call attention to the circumstance that even your
opponents respect the honesty of your convictions. I
will not inquire into that assertion” (Bismarck’s comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span>
in pencil: “Not over courteous,”) “but if you attach
any importance to the opinions of your opponents, the
circumstance that the great majority of the educated
classes among our people deny the constitutional
character of the ordinance must necessarily awaken
scruples in your mind. The Ministry knew beforehand
that this would be the case. It was also aware that the
Diet would never have approved the provisions of that
rescript beforehand, and it therefore laid no Bill before
the Diet, and in a few days promulgated the ordinance
under Article 63 of the Constitution. If the country
does not recognise in this course of action a loyal
administration of the Constitution, I would ask what
has the Ministry done to bring public opinion round to
its own view? It found no other means of coming to an
understanding with public opinion than to impose
silence upon it. It would be idle to waste a single word
as to how far this ordinance harmonises with the respect
and good will due to a willing and loyal people that has
been condemned to silence because the Government will
not hear its voice.</p>

<p>“And what is the success which you anticipate from
this policy? The tranquillisation of the public mind and
the restoration of peace? Do you believe that you can
appease public sentiment by again offending its sense of
justice? It seems to me contrary to human nature to
expect a change when the existing feeling is being constantly
confirmed and aggravated by the action of the
Government. I will tell you what results I anticipate
from your policy. You will go on quibbling with the
Constitution until it loses all value in the eyes of the
people. In that way you will on the one hand arouse
anarchical movements that go beyond the bounds of the
Constitution; while on the other hand, whether you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>
intend it or not, you will pass from one venturesome
interpretation to another until you are finally driven
into an open breach of the Constitution.” (Bismarck’s
comment: “Perhaps.”) “I regard those who lead his
Majesty the King, my most gracious father, into such
courses as the most dangerous advisers for Crown and
country.” (Bismarck quotes in pencil: “<span lang="de">Leicht fertig
ist die Jugend mit dem Wort</span>” = Youth is hasty in its
judgments.) “P.S.&mdash;Already before the 1st of June of
this year I but rarely made use of my right to attend
the sittings of the Ministry of State. From the foregoing
statement of my convictions you will understand
my requesting his Majesty the King to allow me to
abstain altogether from attending them at present. A
continuous public and personal manifestation of the
differences between myself and the Ministry” (Bismarck’s
pencil remarks on this point: “Absalom!”) “would be
in keeping neither with my position nor my inclination.
In every other respect, however, I shall impose no
restrictions upon the expression of my views; and the
Ministry may rest assured that it will depend upon
themselves and their own future action whether, in
spite of my own strong reluctance, I find myself forced
into further public steps, when duty appears to call for
them.” (In face of the menacing attitude assumed in
these threats, Bismarck’s undaunted pencil shouts out,
“Come on!” “Nur zu!”)</p>
</div>

<p>On the 3rd of September the Crown Prince writes
to Bismarck: “I have to-day communicated to his
Majesty the views which I set forth to you in my letter
from Putbus, and which I begged you not to submit to
the King until I myself had done so. A decision which
will have serious consequences was yesterday taken in the
Council. I did not wish to reply to his Majesty in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span>
presence of the Ministers. I have done so to-day, and
have given expression to my misgivings&mdash;my serious
misgivings&mdash;for the future. The King now knows
that I am a decided opponent of the Ministry.” At
the end of the letter Bismarck added, apparently as
part of a draft reply: “I can only hope that your
Royal Highness will one day find servants as faithful
as I am to your father. I do not intend to be of the
number.”</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, while at Danzig, during a tour
in the performance of his military duties, the Crown
Prince, speaking in public to the Chief Burgomaster
Von Winter, declared himself to be opposed to the
policy of his father. The latter wrote demanding a
recantation, and stating that otherwise the Prince
would be deprived of his dignity and position. The
Crown Prince declined to retract anything, offered to
lay down his command and other offices, and begged to
be allowed to retire with his family to some place where
he would be under no suspicion of interfering in State
affairs. Intimations as to the contents of this correspondence
were published (of course, first of all) in <cite>The
Times</cite>, then in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> (through Gustav
Freytag) and in the <cite lang="de">Süddeutsche Zeitung</cite> (through me,
at Freytag’s instance). A memorandum, dated Gastein,
the 2nd of August, in Zitelmann’s handwriting, and
probably dictated by Bismarck, expresses the belief that
the publication was due to the Crown Princess, “whether
it be that she has herself attained to definite views of
her own as to the form of government most advantageous
for Prussia, or that she has succumbed to the concerted
influences of the Anglo-Coburg combination.
However this may be, it is asserted that she has decided
upon a course of opposition to the present Government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span>
and has taken advantage of the Danzig incident and
the excitement to which it has given rise in the highest
circles, in order to bring her consort more and more
into prominence by these revelations, and to acquaint
public opinion with the Crown Prince’s way of thinking.
All this out of anxiety for the future of her consort.”
It is then stated that the Crown Princess’s most
powerful supporter is Queen Augusta, who is extremely
anxious as to her own position towards the country.
They have had a memorandum drawn up by President
Camphausen on the internal situation in Prussia, attacking
the present Government, which was laid before the
King. In a marginal note the King observes that the
principles therein recommended would lead to revolution.
Meyer, the Councillor of Embassy, is Augusta’s
instrument, and it is beyond question that he is associated
with the Anglo-Coburg party. The participation
of Professor Duncker<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as also of Baron Stockmar, would
appear to be less certain. The memorandum dictated
to Zitelmann is accompanied by comments in the Chief’s
handwriting&mdash;either a long letter or a <i lang="la" title="memorandum">pro memoriâ</i> for
the King&mdash;in which the views expressed by the Crown
Prince are refuted point by point. In the course of his
criticism the writer says, <i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>: “The pretension
that a warning from his Royal Highness should outweigh
royal decisions, come to after serious and careful
consideration, attributes undue importance to his own
position and experience as compared to those of his
sovereign and father. No one could believe that
<abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> had any share in these acts of personal
authority, as everybody knows that the Prince has no
vote in the Ministry.... The <i lang="fr" title="denial">démenti</i> at Danzig was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span>
therefore superfluous. The liberty of <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> to form
his own conclusions was not affected by his attendance
at the sittings, where he can keep himself in touch
with the affairs of State and hear the views of others
and express his own, which we hold to be the
duty of the heir to the throne. The performance of
this duty, when it becomes known through the newspapers,
can only elicit on all sides approval of the
diligence and conscientiousness with which the Crown
Prince prepares himself for his high and serious vocation.
The words ‘with my hands tied’ have no meaning.
It is utterly impossible that the country should
identify <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> with the Ministry, as the country
knows that the Crown Prince is not called upon to take
any official part in its decisions.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, the attitude which <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> has
adopted towards the Crown is sufficiently known
in the country, and is condemned by every father
of a family, to whatever path he may belong, as a disavowal
of that paternal authority which it is an offence
to our feelings and traditions to ignore. Even now
clergymen are preaching from the text 2 Samuel, ch. xv.,
verses 3 and 4. <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> could not be more seriously
damaged in the eyes of public opinion than by the publication
of this answer.” (That of the Prince to his
father’s letter.)</p>

<p>Page 2 (of the answer). “It is true that <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr>’s
situation is a thoroughly false one, because it is not
the business of the heir to the throne to raise the
banner of opposition to his King and father. He can
only fulfil his ‘duty’ by retiring from that position and
again adopting a proper attitude.”</p>

<p>Page 3. “There is no conflict of duties, as the first of
these duties is self-imposed. It rests with the King,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span>
and not with the Crown Prince, to provide for the future
of Prussia, and the future will show whether ‘mistakes’
have been made, and on which side. In cases where the
‘judgment’ of his Majesty is opposed to that of the
Crown Prince, the former must always be preponderant,
and there is therefore no conflict. <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> himself
recognises that in our Constitution there is ‘no place
for the opposition of the heir to the throne.’ Opposition
within the Council does not exclude obedience to
his Majesty once a matter has been decided. Ministers
also oppose when they hold different views, but they nevertheless
obey” (The last three words are underlined in
pencil by the King, who added on the margin: ‘When
it is not opposed to their consciences,’) “the will of the
King, although it may be part of their duty to carry into
execution the measures they opposed.”</p>

<p>Page 4. “If <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> knows that the Ministers act in
accordance with the will of the King, he cannot fail to
see that the opposition of the heir to the throne is
directed against the reigning King himself.”</p>

<p>Page 5. “The Crown Prince has no call and no
justification to enter upon a ‘struggle’ (Kampf) against
the will of the King, for the precise reason that his
Royal Highness has no official status. Each Prince of
the Royal House would be equally justified in ‘laying
claim’ to the duty of offering public opposition to the
King, where his views differed from those of the
sovereign, and thus defending the eventual rights of
‘himself and his children’ against the effects of alleged
mistakes by the Government of the King, that is to say,
in order to secure the succession, after the manner of
Louis Philippe, if the King were to be deposed by a
revolution.”</p>

<p>Page 6. “The Minister President is to give a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span>
detailed explanation of the words used by him at
Gastein.”</p>

<p>Page 7. “His Majesty has not caused the Crown
Prince to attend the sittings as one of the King’s advisers,
but only for the Prince’s own information, and as a
means of preparing him for his future calling. The
attempt to ‘neutralise’ the measures of the Government
would mean a struggle and rebellion against the Crown.
More dangerous than all the attacks of the democracy
and all ‘gnawing’ at the roots of the monarchy is the
loosening of the bonds that still unite the people with
the dynasty through the example of open and avowed
opposition on the part of the heir to the throne,
through the intentional disclosure of discord in the
Royal House itself. If the son and heir to the throne
revolts against the authority of the father and King, to
whom can that authority still remain sacred? If a
premium is set by ambition for the <em>future</em> upon present
desertion from the Sovereign, every bond will be loosened,
to the detriment of the future King, and the damage
done to the authority of the present Government will
bear evil fruit for its successors. Any Government is
better than one which is divided against itself and
paralysed. The shocks which the Crown Prince may
provoke affect the foundations of the structure over which
he himself will hereafter have to preside as King.</p>

<p>“According to the constitutional law hitherto in
force, it is the King who <em>governs</em> in Prussia and not the
Ministers. Legislative and not governmental power is
alone shared with the Chambers, and before them the
Ministers represent the King. Therefore now, as <em>before</em>
the Constitution, the Ministers are legally the servants of
the King, and his Majesty’s authorised advisers, but
they are not the regents of the Prussian State. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>
since the Constitution, the Prussian monarchy does not
stand on the same level as the Belgian or English
monarchy. On the contrary, in Prussia the King still
governs personally, and <em>commands</em> according to his own
discretion, in so far as the Constitution has not otherwise
provided, and it has only so provided in matters of
legislation.”</p>

<p>Page 8. “The publication of State secrets is an
offence against the criminal law. What is to be treated
as a State secret depends upon the King’s command
respecting official secrecy. Why is so much importance
attached to giving ‘outside’ publicity to these matters?
If his Royal Highness, as in duty bound, gives expression
to his opinions in Council, he has satisfied his conscience.
The Crown Prince has no official position
whatever in State affairs, and no call to express himself
publicly upon them. No one who has even a superficial
knowledge of the system under which our State affairs
are conducted would conclude that the Crown Prince
agreed with the decisions of the Government merely because
he (without a vote, and therefore without the
possibility of effectual opposition) had listened to the
discussions in Council.</p>

<p>“‘Not appear better.’ The mistake lies in the exaggerated
importance attached to ‘appearances.’ The
important point is what a man is and what he can do,
and that is only the fruit of serious and well-directed
labour.</p>

<p>“The participation of his Royal Highness in the
Council is not ‘active,’ and no ‘votes’ are cast by the
Crown Prince. The communication to ‘responsible’ (?)
persons without the authorisation of his Majesty would
be an offence against the criminal law. Of course, there
is no limitation of his Royal Highness’s right to express<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span>
his views; on the contrary, it is desirable that he should
do so, but only in the Council, where, as a matter of fact,
they can alone have any influence on the decisions that
are about to be taken. The contrary course, ‘to express
them openly before the country,’ can only be adopted as
a means of gratifying his Royal Highness’s <i lang="fr">amour
propre</i>, and must result in promoting discontent and
disaffection, and thereby paving the way for revolution.”</p>

<p>Page 10. “Unquestionably <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> will render
their work more difficult for the Ministers, and their
task would be lighter if he did not attend the sittings.
But can his Majesty shirk the duty of doing everything
that is humanly possible to enable the Crown
Prince to learn the business of State, and to become
acquainted with the laws of the country? Is it not a
dangerous experiment to leave the future King a stranger
to the affairs of State, while the welfare of millions is
dependent upon his familiarity with them? <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr>
shows himself in the present memorandum unacquainted
with the fact that the participation of the Crown Prince
never involves any responsibility, and is only for the
purpose of information, and that <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> can never be
asked to give a vote. The whole argument is based
upon a misconception of this fact. If the Crown Prince
had been more familiar with State affairs <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> could
not have thought of publishing the proceedings of the
Council in case the King did not accede to his wishes,
<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, of committing an offence against the law, and what
is more, the criminal law, and that too a few weeks after
<abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> had himself severely censured the publication
of the correspondence with his Majesty.”</p>

<p>Page 11. “Certainly the reproach mentioned may
naturally occur to every one in the country. No one
charges <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> with such an intention, but it is said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span>
that <em>others</em>, who do entertain such an intention, hope to
see it realised through the unconscious co-operation of the
Crown Prince; and that such wicked attempts now
afford those who originated them a better prospect than
formerly of a change of system.”</p>

<p>Page 12. “The demand to have timely information
of the business to be transacted at the sittings is
perfectly legitimate, has always been recognised, and
shall continue to be so. Indeed a desire has been
expressed that <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> should do his part in keeping
himself more <i lang="fr" title="up to date">au courant</i> than was hitherto possible.
For this purpose <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr>’s whereabouts must always be
known and within reach, the Ministers must have access
to the Crown Prince, and discretion must be secured.
But it is necessary that the <i lang="de">Vortragende Räthe</i>
(Councillors who have the privilege of direct audience),
with whom alone <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> can be authorised to transact
current State affairs, should be not opponents but friends
of the Government, or at least impartial critics having
no <em>intimate</em> relations with the Opposition in the Diet
and the press. The most difficult point of all is <em>discretion</em>,
particularly towards foreign countries, so long as
<abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> and the Crown Princess are not thoroughly conscious
that in reigning houses the nearest relations are
not always fellow countrymen, but, on the contrary,
must necessarily, and as in duty bound, represent other
than Prussian interests. It is hard that a frontier
should create a division of interest between mother and
daughter, brother and sister, but to forget this fact is
always a danger for the State. The ‘last sitting of the
Council’ (on the 3rd) was not a regular sitting but
only a meeting of the Ministers who had been summoned
by his Majesty without their own previous knowledge.”</p>

<p>Page 13. “Communication to the Ministers would give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>
the memorandum an official character which the Prince’s
effusions do not in themselves possess.”</p>

<p>On Monday, the 22nd of October, Count Herbert was
present at lunch and dinner, returning to Berlin on the
Tuesday. On Monday, after we had had our coffee, I
told the Chief that the sorting of the papers was now
well advanced. There was a great deal more to do, however,
than had appeared at first, and it might take
eight or ten days more before I could hand them over
to him in good order like the previous set. He
replied: “Take plenty of time. But the Emperor will be
here in a few days and you must not let yourself be seen
then; or, better still, go to Hamburg while he is here,
as otherwise he will ask who you are and what you are
doing. I should then be obliged to tell him, and as he
is curious he would eventually seize the whole lot, which
would not suit me at all.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday I was very busy sorting,
numbering and taking extracts. In the evening I took
a walk with the Privy Councillor until an hour before
dinner. We were joined at dinner on Wednesday by
the Hamburg merchant, Merck, and his wife&mdash;she very
pretty, twenty-seven years of age, and he between forty
and fifty. On Thursday I was again hard at work on
the Chief’s treasury of letters. At lunch the Chief said
that formerly the rich and influential Hamburgers were
strongly Austrian in their sympathies, and he referred to
the millions advanced to the politicians of Vienna in
1857, and also condemned the unamiable and stupid
policy of Prussia in those days. The Princess observed
that even now these circles do not care much for
Prussia, but are impressed, and indeed very strongly, by
Bismarck. She then explained to me that the Mercks
were neighbours of theirs, and occupied a country house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span>
with forty acres of ground on the edge of the forest, the
remainder of an estate which a Saxon officer had acquired
by marriage, and of which the Prince afterwards
bought six hundred acres. In reply to my question, the
Chief informed me that the Emperor would arrive on
Monday evening and leave after lunch on Tuesday. I
must therefore make myself scarce for thirty hours.
To-day, however, we shall return to our anthology,
and continue it to-morrow. Here follow some further
specimens of the selection.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Letter from Bismarck to the King on the 1st of
December, 1863: “Your Majesty has been gracious
enough to send me Herr von Gruner’s communication of
the 28th ultimo, and to observe that it reproduces the
views adopted by your Majesty. Herr von Gruner’s
opinions are based on the same general principles as
those of Herr von Vincke and Herr von Roggenbach,
and the latter have found expression in the letter of
<abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> the Grand Duke of Baden. These gentlemen,
in addressing their proposals to your Majesty, doubtless
proceed on the assumption that if your Majesty were to
accept their advice another Ministry would be summoned
to office. Other influences are also being set in motion
for this purpose even outside <em>public</em> life, to which Herr
von Schleinitz and other persons closely connected with
the Court have either voluntarily or involuntarily
devoted their services. When I entered into the Ministry
I ventured to explain to your Majesty that I did not
regard my position as that of a Constitutional Minister
in the usual sense of the word, but considered myself
rather as your Majesty’s servant, and that in the last
resort I would obey your Majesty’s commands even if
contrary to my own views. I still maintain that standpoint,
but this should not deter me from explaining my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span>
views with the candour I owe to your Majesty and to
the interests of the country. Speaking in this sense, I
must first declare that I consider it would be of advantage
for your Majesty’s service, in carrying out a policy
consonant with the views of Herr von Gruner, to select
another Ministry, or at least another Minister for
Foreign Affairs, who would enjoy in a higher degree the
confidence of those upon whose support such a policy
must mainly rely. Count Goltz has as yet had no
occasion to come into conflict with those elements, and
owing to his other qualifications may be regarded as
best suited to take over the conduct of affairs.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>From a letter of the Crown Prince to Bismarck,
dated Headquarters, Flensburg, April 17th, 1864: “I
thank you heartily for your two letters of the 11th and
12th of April. I found the communication of the 11th
very interesting; but I could not gather from it such a
view of the objects of our policy as would enable me,
from my standpoint, to support any particular measure
with conviction. I do not agree that it is too early to
come forward openly with a positive programme, and I
fear that we shall gain <em>nothing</em> by protracting the solution
of the question, but, on the contrary, thereby
increase European complications. However that may
be, we should at least have a positive programme <em>for ourselves</em>,
the realisation of which it is true would still remain
dependent upon circumstances. Instead of this, however,
I find in your communication only the programme
‘to act according to circumstances,’ unless I am to infer
from some isolated suggestions certain secret views which
are ascribed to you, and which certainly appear to tally
with many of your former utterances, particularly at the
last Council which I attended before my departure for
the army. With regard to any such <i lang="fr" title="concealed thoughts">arrière-pensées</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>
Prussian aggrandisement, I may state briefly my opinion,
namely, that to pursue them would entirely falsify
our whole German policy, and would probably lead to
our defeat by Europe. It would not be the first time
that Prussia sought to outwit the world, with the
result that she ultimately fell between two stools.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A letter from Bismarck to the King, dated April 3rd,
1866: “Your Majesty has deigned to command me,
through Abeken, to express my opinion whether the
letter from the Duke of Coburg, which I respectfully
return herewith, should be answered.</p>

<p>“I take the liberty to recall the fact that the Duke
of Coburg has during the past four years shared in every
intrigue against your Majesty’s internal and foreign
policy. His Highness has largely contributed to the
return of democratic representatives in Prussia through
his money and influence; he has associated himself with
societies for arming the people (Büchsen-Groschen Vereine),
and has adopted such an attitude towards the
monarchy that your Majesty made strong representations
to him on the subject in a long letter, and declined
a visit from him on account of the bad impression it
would make on the army. The Duke, together with his
officials, Samwer and Francke, is the leader of the anti-Prussian
Augustenburg movement; and but for him the
hereditary Prince would have listened to reason. The
Duke brought about the recall of Lord Napier, a diplomatist
who was regarded as too Prussophil. I respectfully
take the liberty of indicating the influence of the
Duke upon <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> the Crown Prince. I certainly do
not go too far when I describe his Highness as one of
the most irreconcilable opponents of your Majesty’s
policy, and state that no devotion to your Majesty’s
honour and interest is to be expected from him. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span>
present letter from the Duke, and that from Count
Mensdorff, which was obviously ordered for the special
purpose of being communicated to your Majesty, and
which is utterly untrue, betray their connection with
the communications from Queen Victoria which have
reached your Majesty through <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> the Crown Prince;
and it is certain that similar insinuations will have been
made to your Majesty in other quarters. There can be
no doubt that all these steps are based upon a well-laid
plan, according to which the open and secret opponents
of your Majesty endeavour to persuade your Majesty to
yield to Austria, and thus to pave the way for another
policy, your Majesty’s present Ministry and myself in
particular being for this purpose represented in the first
place as the root of all evil. Your Majesty is certainly
convinced without any assurance from me that even if
my health had remained unaffected during the past few
years, I would at any moment willingly, and with lifelong
gratitude to your Majesty for the many favours
which I have enjoyed, retire into private life even if my
continuance in office involved <em>no</em> detriment to your
Majesty. How much more willingly would I do so,
therefore, if my retirement could be of any benefit to my
King and country. I see, however, no possibility of
another Minister of your Majesty being able honestly
to recommend a policy different to that which has
hitherto been followed, and which was sanctioned in the
Council of the 28th of February; for this policy is
independent of all partisan tendencies, is enjoined solely
by the interests of Prussia, and is rendered inevitable by
the situation. If the Duke of Coburg recommends
another policy, such as would be in agreement with
what Vienna prescribes, I beg respectfully to point out
that the same gentleman has for the last four years recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span>
<em>everything</em> that was opposed to monarchical
interests, and in particular to those of the Prussian
Monarchy. Notwithstanding this your Majesty has
done him the honour of answering his letter of the
22nd. If your Majesty were to answer the present
letter, with its offensive and untruthful enclosure, that
would be an encouragement to your opponents and a
discouragement to your servants. My most humble
advice is that your Majesty should leave the letter of
the Duke unanswered, and not conceal from his aide-de-camp
that you have been disagreeably affected by the
enclosure. If the aide-de-camp is a person to whom such
a communication might be properly made, it would
perhaps be well to signify to him verbally that your

<p>Letter from the King to Bismarck, dated April 8th,
1866: “Numbers 78 and 79 of the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite> have
just been laid before me by an unknown hand (as I have
not taken in this paper since 1861&mdash;Coronation article
in June) on account of the abusive article against the
Duke of Coburg. It is most unpleasant to me, as only
you, the Queen and the Crown Prince had a knowledge
of the Duke’s letters to me, and therefore the source of
the article is immediately betrayed. Although you have
always told me that the Government has no influence
upon the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite>, this appears to be an instance
which contradicts that statement. The manner
in which I replied to the Duke, and the fact that on the
second occasion I sent no reply, showed him that I did
not desire to continue the correspondence. But articles
like that in question must render him still more hostile
to us. From a political point of view this is not right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span>
and on that account I request you to put a stop to these
improper proceedings of the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite> towards the
Duke.</p>

<p>In reply to this Bismarck wrote as follows: “I
humbly beg your Majesty’s pardon if I have called down
upon myself your Majesty’s dissatisfaction through the
article on the intervention of the Duke of Coburg, which
was based, not on his letter, but upon a number of other
newspaper reports on this intervention. I would never
venture to deceive your Majesty, and I frankly confess
that the main part of this article was written at my
instance, as I&mdash;like every one of my colleagues&mdash;while
having indeed no influence over the <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite> to
prevent the insertion of matters to which I object, have
yet enough to secure the insertion of what is not directly
opposed to its own tendencies. The same connection
exists with the <cite lang="de">Spenersche</cite>, the <cite lang="de">National Zeitung</cite> and
many others, and I believe I have never denied the
existence of influence of this description.</p>

<p>“It appeared to me as if your Majesty were yourself
indignant at the insincerity of the Duke and of Count
Mensdorff; but your Majesty generously pardons the
disrespect manifested in such conduct, as also the former
hostility of the Duke, who has done more harm to your
Majesty and the Prussian State through the favour which
he has shown to the democracy, and the disturbance of
the relations with England, than he can ever make good
through a military convention, and who gave evidence
of his real sentiments towards your Majesty at the time
of the Congress of Princes. Your Majesty, while entertaining
no doubt as to my devotion and obedience, will
not expect me to be superior to every human weakness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span>
and to preserve my composure at all times when I see
how my heavy, and I may fairly say exhausting, duties
are intentionally rendered more difficult by the displeasure
of such highly placed personages, in whose hearts the
success of Prussian policy and the renown of your
Majesty and of the Royal House should naturally be
expected to hold a first place. And why am I subjected
to this implacable displeasure and forced into this
struggle with powerful influences which I have to meet
at every step I take? Merely because I will not consent
to serve two masters, nor carry out another policy than
your Majesty’s, nor reckon with other influences than
your Majesty’s commands. My offence is that I was
ready to serve your Majesty according to your own will
when others declined to do so, and that I did not
hesitate to obey your Majesty at the risk of drawing
down upon myself the displeasure of those who stand
nearest to your Majesty. I could have peace if, like
many of my predecessors, I were prepared to submit to
your Majesty as my own convictions what was suggested
to me in other quarters; and if, in particular, I were to
advise you to give way in matters of internal policy
and military organisation, as of course nothing is really
being done in foreign affairs except what was formerly
desired by those who now oppose me. I beg your
Majesty to forgive me if in this struggle, owing to the
feeling that I have been unjustly attacked for the sole
reason that I have tried to do my duty towards your
Majesty without looking to the right or to the left, I
have lost that composure which I myself am desirous of
preserving.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Letter from Bismarck to the King, dated 2nd May,
1866: “I respectfully submit to your Majesty the communication
which has just been received from Vienna.
It vouchsafes no prospect that Austria will disarm, but
seems to indicate that she merely wants to put us off for
a few days in order to complete her armaments before
adopting another tone towards your Majesty, in the
belief that she will then have secured a start of us
which we could no longer make up. Information reaches
me from the Bourse that it is intended to adopt financial
measures of a ruinous character (forced loans?) and that
the trading community here, including its representative
bodies, regard the inactivity of the Royal House in
presence of the superior armaments of Austria, as inconceivable,
and in the highest degree alarming and
detrimental to the country. This feeling, which has
prevailed among your Majesty’s Ministers before to-day,
has now become general in the city since the facts which
were previously known to the Government have found
their way into publicity. This feeling would certainly
find violent expression should the event show, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span>
God forbid, that there had been any actual negligence in
providing for the protection of the country.”</p>
</div>

<p>On Friday at lunch the Chief asked me: “What is
your opinion, Busch, of Goethe’s tragedies, and of his
dramas altogether?” I replied that he was less of a
dramatist than a lyric poet, but that “Faust,” setting
aside the second part, was after all a most wonderful
production. “Yes, certainly,” he said, “and ‘Götz’ too,
but ‘Egmont,’ the man in ‘Stella,’ Tasso, and the leading
characters in the others, are all Weislingens&mdash;weak
soft, sentimental creatures&mdash;not men as in Shakespeare,
always repetitions of himself, for he too had something
feminine in him, and could only realise and portray the
feelings of women.” I finally recommended Victor
Hehn’s “Gedanken über Goethe,” and referred him in
particular to the first and second chapters. Towards
evening another long walk with Rottenburg, while the
Prince went to Schwarzenbeck and the Princess to
Hamburg, probably to make purchases in view of the
Emperor’s visit. Both were back for dinner, at which
the Ranger or Chief Ranger of Schleswig-Holstein, and
the Head Forester Lange were also present. The conversation
at table turned chiefly on forestry, the various
species of trees, and other wooden subjects. A further
selection from the Chief’s papers, the arrangement of
which will be complete in four or five days. A letter of
the 5th of January, 1876, from the Crown Prince introduces
Professor Geffcken, who has been to see him, and
with whom he has been speaking about his book, <cite lang="de">Staat
und Kirche</cite> (State and Church), as a man “of ripe
thought and great experience.” The Chief replied on
the 8th: “Dr. Geffcken belongs to that party in the
Evangelical Church which, like President von Gerlach
and some other Protestants, is in alliance with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span>
Centre party and the Jesuits, and which has been and
still is hostile to every phase of the German Empire’s
development.” The letter goes on to say that his book
is a superficial compilation; that his criticism of the
Falk laws gives evidence of audacious presumption
rather than of impartial consideration; and that his
Augustenburg and Hanseatic Particularism has not been
overcome by the restoration of the Empire, whose
interests he opposes in Alsace. “If I were to see him
without the presence of witnesses (which the Crown
Prince seemed from his letter to desire) I should have
reason to apprehend that my intercourse with such a
tool of sectarian intrigue would arouse the mistrust of
my colleagues and of public opinion.”</p>

<p>The Crown Prince thinks otherwise. He replied on
the 12th of January: “During the many years of my
acquaintance with Dr. Geffcken I have never seen any
leaning on his part to Catholicism, nor any opposition
to Prussia as a matter of principle. On the contrary I
could see from his whole attitude, as well as from the
statements frequently made by him, that there is as
little reason to doubt his ardent Protestantism as there
is to question his patriotism.”</p>

<p>In a letter of the 12th of May, 1876, <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> cannot
too strongly urge the Chancellor to give Friedberg the
Imperial Secretaryship of State for Justice, which it
was proposed to establish. He at the same time tried to
meet the objections which Bismarck supposed the
Emperor to entertain. According to a letter of the 30th
of June from the Crown Prince to Bismarck Friedberg
had acquired a claim upon his gratitude by his long
service, which frequently involved difficulties and sacrifices,
but was always marked with the same devotion.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June, 1878, the Crown Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span>
writing to the Chief on the death of King George of
Hanover, says <i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>: “I am of opinion that now,
the unfortunate Prince being dead, we must above all
things adopt a generous attitude towards his relatives.”</p>

<p>The Crown Prince now writes to the Chancellor more
frequently than before. From the 6th of July, 1879,
onwards, the project of marrying Prince William to the
daughter of the Augustenburger was repeatedly mentioned,
Bismarck being asked to promote it. Bismarck
submitted his opinion of the scheme. (Professor Schulz
prepared a similar statement, in which he proved the
Augustenburger’s equality of birth, which had been
strongly questioned.) In this opinion the Chief recommends
as indispensable a previous renunciation by
Duke Frederick.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Correspondence in connection with the
Negotiations respecting the German Alliance with
Austria.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Andrassy writes to Bismarck (neat handwriting in
Latin characters): “Schönbrunn, 1st September, 1879.
Honoured Prince! Before leaving Gastein I communicated
<i lang="la" title="in a nutshell">in nuce</i> by telegraph to my most gracious master,
who went direct from Prague to Bruck, the tendency
and the result so far of our conferences. I laid special
stress on the fact that in view of the warlike preparations
and the threatening language which was heard
alternately, both in Vienna and in Germany, the question
we had to deal with was that of a defensive understanding,
a sort of guarantee of insurance, between our two
sovereigns, in the sense that any attack upon either of
the two empires should be repelled by their united
forces, and that the <i lang="la"  title="case in which an alliance comes into operation">casus fœderis</i> should also arise in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span>
the event of an attack upon either by a third Power with
the co-operation of Russia. I afterwards emphasised
the circumstance that I was strongly in favour of this
combination, but nevertheless had not in any way
pledged his Majesty. Hereupon I received on my
arrival a telegram from Prague, in which the Emperor
declares that he approves of the tendency and present
results of our meeting from the <em>fullest conviction</em>, and
invites me to go to see him in camp at <a id="TN8"></a>Bruck. I was
at Bruck yesterday, and had an opportunity of submitting
a detailed report on the subject. I found the
Emperor so fully convinced of the usefulness and, indeed,
necessity of such an arrangement, that further argument
in its favour proved to be superfluous. His Majesty sees
therein not only no departure from the determination to
maintain peace between the three empires, but the only
possible way at the present moment of removing the
sword of Damocles which constantly hangs over our
relations, and of securing peace for the benefit of both
States, and, indeed, for the welfare of the <em>third</em>. As a
matter of course, my Emperor is always glad to see you
here, and will be particularly glad to do so on the
present occasion. In the meantime, I am authorised as
soon as you are in a position to inform me that you have
obtained the approval in principle of the Emperor
William to receive your draft text and to prepare one
myself. I am to remain in office until this matter is
completed, my successor only taking over the conduct
of affairs after the understanding has been concluded.
Besides, I have initiated him into the question, and he
is in perfect agreement.</p>

<p>“Thus far as to what concerns his Majesty. The
following is personal and quite confidential. I have
not ceased to think over the matter for myself from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span>
points of view, and my conviction has thereby been
strengthened. If immediately after a war for which no
one in Russia will to-day accept the responsibility and
which has weakened the Empire both from a financial
and military standpoint, and at a time when the Nihilist
movement is momentarily suppressed and there is
nothing to force the Government to seek a diversion
abroad, Germany is to be threatened with France, and
ourselves with an increase of the army, and that in
connection with such questions as Merkovitch and the
post offices of Eastern Rumelia, what is to be expected
when the wounds of war are healed, when internal
difficulties again make themselves felt, and when a
foreign diversion may seem the only means of escape?</p>

<p>“I must confess that I can have no ease of mind so
long as I do not see the torch extinguished which the
Emperor Alexander half unconsciously swings about
over the European powder barrel, and while I know the
peace of Europe to rest in the hands of a Milutin, a
Jomini, and doubtless presently of an Ignatieff. I
believe that to-day every State (although our own less
than others) has enough to do to protect its authority
against the subversive elements in its midst. How is
that to be done, however, and who will be able to do it
if the State is constantly obliged to devote half its power
and attention to dangers which are not of an internal
but of a foreign character, and which come not from
below but from above? I entertain no doubt as to the
personal intentions of the Emperor Alexander. I am
convinced that he does not wish for war at present.
But as the Minister of a neighbouring State I cannot
forget that he had also no desire for the war just concluded,
and that from the beginning to the end of it he
was trying to master the movement which had originated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span>
in his immediate <i lang="fr">entourage</i>. I consider it a
European necessity to provide in some way against this
danger, and however difficult I find it now to postpone
my retirement which is already widely known to be
impending, it would be an immense gratification to me,
as a servant of my Emperor and country, to be able to
join with you, honoured Prince, in signing this guarantee
for the future of our two realms. Austria once
committed the mistake of declining the overtures of
Germany which would have secured our mutual interests.
It is a satisfaction to me to be able to state
that the same mistake will not be committed by us
this time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To this Bismarck replied on the 3rd of September:
“<span class="smcap">Honoured Count</span>,&mdash;Yesterday evening I received your
letter of the 1st instant, which is a source of much
pleasure and satisfaction to me. I hasten to send you
a provisional answer. And, first, I beg you to convey
to his Majesty the Emperor my respectful thanks for
the gracious manner in which he has referred to my intention
to come to Vienna. I am pleased to see from
your letter that his Majesty (unser Herr) has one foot
in the stirrup, and do not doubt that our united efforts
will succeed in placing him firmly in the saddle. Unfortunately,
from the nature of things, geographical and
political, my task cannot be so speedily completed as
yours. A verbal report has not only the advantage of
saving time, but also that of confining the replies to
such questions as are actually raised in the most exalted
quarter. In a written report I must, as a measure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span>
precaution, discuss all the misunderstandings of which I
may apprehend the possibility. It has, therefore, come
to pass that I have been obliged to dictate to my son
(who, with your kind permission, also writes this letter)
sixty pages, the contents of which I was further obliged
to expand in detail by telegraphic and other additions.
Nevertheless, I have not succeeded, in spite of all my
pains, in entirely removing the apprehension that our
peaceful scheme may conceal some secret views of an
aggressive character. This idea is unwelcome to a
gentleman of over eighty-two years of age, but I hope
I may be able to dispel it altogether, even if it costs me
a somewhat lengthy postscript to those sixty pages. My
master’s disinclination to a speedy acceptance of new
situations, which is a feature of his character, offers less
scope for my activity. For his Majesty, the attitude
recently adopted by the Emperor Alexander has for the
first time illuminated, as with a lightning flash, a situation
which I have been repeatedly obliged to recognise
during the past few years. It will be a matter of
extreme difficulty for his Majesty to find himself forced
into making a choice between the two neighbouring
empires, and he will therefore close his mind as long as
possible to the conviction that the moment has come
for such a course. In our Royal House habit exercises
an enormous power, and the instinct of persistence
grows stronger with age, and resists the recognition
of undoubted changes in the outer world. Besides, the
Emperor Alexander (I do not know whether it be due to
the influence of others, or to his own determination)
now endeavours to force the Jupiter Tonans into the
background by a rapid transition to sunshine. In this
sense the last threatening utterances were followed
within a week by a friendly invitation to send a Prussian
officer to Warsaw. This was accepted by my Emperor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span>
who announced the despatch of Field-Marshal Manteuffel
and suite, without my previous knowledge of this step,
as a military measure. Baron Manteuffel met at Warsaw
with very considerable readiness to make advances, in
the sincerity and permanence of which however, after all
that has passed, I cannot place any confidence. I am not
as yet aware whether the meeting which is to take place
to-day at Alexandrowo, was suggested by him or by the
Russians. The objections on this side against a meeting
on Russian soil have been disposed of by a reference to
the difficulty of taking with equal promptitude outside
of Russia the necessary precautions for the safety of the
Emperor Alexander. So far as I know this meeting
takes place to-day, our Emperor being accompanied by
an aide-de-camp. According to a report of Minister von
Bülow it is mainly inspired by a desire to obtain from
the Emperor Alexander an explanation of his threatening
attitude. Before this has taken place I cannot expect
an answer to my report, which was first communicated
to the Emperor on the 2nd, and to which I have up to the
present only received a telegraphic reply through Bülow.
From Bülow’s telegram, however, it appears that even now
the Emperor approves of my re-opening at Vienna the conferences
with you, upon which I have already reported to
him (&mdash;At first he was opposed even to Bismarck’s returning
home by way of Vienna&mdash;), but that nothing must be
settled without his approval. Of course that goes without
saying and you will not be impatient if my master
requires before coming to a decision the time which his
years, his habits, and the novelty of the outlook demand.
There is also a further circumstance which indeed is
favourable to our plans, namely that <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> the Crown
Prince was consulted, and therefore that an exchange of
ideas must have taken place between the exalted gentlemen.
From my experience of my Sovereign for years past I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>
had hardly hoped that, within twenty-four hours after
taking cognisance for the first time of such a comprehensive
and novel statement of the situation, he would
without more ado agree to the continuation of our
conferences. As I shall not remain inactive in the meantime
I hope before I leave Gastein to obtain fuller
powers. Like you, every day’s further consideration
confirms my conviction of the usefulness and necessity
of the work which we have undertaken, and I trust God
will grant us to secure for our two great States the
guarantee of external and internal peace towards which
our efforts are directed. I have considered it my duty to
inform you of the stage at which I have arrived in my
work, and I shall continue to do so as soon as I receive
the more detailed expression of my master’s views which
has been promised. Should his Majesty commit this
to paper at Königsberg on the 4th it would come to
my hands on the 7th or at latest the 8th instant. I was
greatly tempted after your departure to go personally to
Berlin in order to plead our cause verbally, but the state
of my health and strength was too indifferent to permit
of such a strain. Moreover, experience has taught me
that in explaining important and difficult matters to my
master I attain my object, not more rapidly, it is true,
but more certainly, by writing than in verbal intercourse,
as, in the latter, difficulties occasionally arise which have
no real connection with the matter under consideration.
I hope to complete my cure here by the 15th or 16th,
and to be then once more equal to the demands of the
coming winter. Trusting that we shall soon meet again,
I remain, with friendly and cordial respect,</p>

<p>Stolberg writes to Bismarck from Berlin on the 17th
of September: “In continuation of my official communication
of to-day, I have the honour dutifully to
inform your Serene Highness of the following. As the
Emperor was almost on the point of giving his approval
he suddenly became embarrassed, and said there was
still another obstacle, which he had mentioned to you in
his last letter, and which obliged him to attach importance
to the exclusion of every possibility of our being
placed under an obligation to support Austria in a war
of aggression against Russia. After some hesitation his
Majesty made me pledge my word that, with the exception
of your Serene Highness, I would speak to no one
on the subject, and then referred to an understanding
entered into by the two Emperors at St. Petersburg in
1873 (with your previous knowledge, but without your
counter-signature), by which each was bound to render
assistance to the other in certain circumstances. This
has obviously been the chief stumbling-block, and has
given rise to the notion of treachery towards the Emperor
Alexander to which Herr von Bülow alluded
from Stettin. Although this statement was too vague
for me, in ignorance of the matter in question, to thoroughly
appreciate the weight of the objection, I considered
it my duty, in view of the approaching decision,
to seize hold of the statement made by the Emperor,
namely, that if the possibility above mentioned were excluded,
his objection would cease, and therefore to
propose the addition.</p>

<p>“Although this objection would be thus obviated, his
Majesty nevertheless wishes to hear what your Serene
Highness has to say upon that point, and desires me to
inform you to that effect. After giving his sanction the
Emperor was somewhat affected, and told me that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span>
decision had cost him a great effort. He believed, however,
that he ought to follow the advice of a tried
counsellor like your Serene Highness.&mdash;I am, with the
profoundest respect, &amp;c.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Stolberg’s suggested addition ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The sanction of the Emperor William to the signature
of the treaty with Austria would be obtained on
condition that the Emperor might write to the Emperor
Alexander: ‘His Majesty is satisfied with the assurances
given in Berlin by Saburoff as to Russia’s love of peace,
and desires, as an evidence of his loyalty and frankness, to
communicate the fact that he <em>was on the point</em> (underlined
in pencil by Bismarck) of concluding a treaty with
Austria, in which the careful cultivation of good relations
was promised, and mutual assistance was only
provided for in cases of attack.’”</p>

<p>The letter from the Emperor to Bismarck, which
Stolberg refers to in the above communication, is dated
Stettin, September 15th, and runs as follows: “After I
had completed my last letter to you, which you will have
received to-day, Field-Marshal Manteuffel forwarded to
me your telegram to him of the 7th instant, with which I
am greatly pleased, as I can see from it that it will be
possible to bring about an understanding between us.
Fortunately this opinion is confirmed by your fourth
report, which reached me yesterday. But an important
point has occurred to me in connection with the pourparlers
which you will hold in Vienna. That is the
Convention dated St. Petersburg, 1873, which was only
signed by the two Field-Marshals, Moltke and Barjatinsky,
and was ratified by the Emperor Alexander and
myself, while you declined to sign. A circumstance
which goes to confirm the &mdash;&mdash; (illegible) which you then
and so often raised against <em>binding</em> Conventions, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span>
circumstances where there was as yet no positive object
in view, for which reason I found much difficulty in
making up my mind to sign the St. Petersburg Convention.
How can you now desire to enter into a convention
without giving notice of withdrawal from that
concluded at St. Petersburg? Both are intended to be
defensive conventions. Now, that of St. Petersburg
binds Prussia and Russia to render each other <em>assistance</em>
in case either should be attacked. The projected Convention
is to contain the same stipulation, but against
Russia. How are these two to be reconciled? It therefore
appears to me that Bülow’s idea (?) of leaving out
the ‘against Russia’ would afford us an opportunity of
drawing Russia into the new Convention, and thereby
fulfilling that of St. Petersburg. As I do not believe
Bülow junior to be initiated into the secret of the St.
Petersburg Convention, I have not been able to speak of
it to him, all the more so as from his silence on the
subject when stating his views he seemed to have no
knowledge of it.</p>

my views, which are known to your Excellency, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span>

to an official communication from my substitute,
Count Stolberg-Wernigerode, the Emperor is prepared
to sanction an agreement under which both Powers
mutually undertake to continue to promote the maintenance
of peace, and in particular to cultivate peaceful
relations between both States and Russia, but, in the
event of either of them being attacked by one or more
Powers, to jointly repel such attack with their entire
united strength. According to this I am empowered by
my most gracious master to propose an unconditional
defensive alliance between Austria-Hungary and the
German Empire, either with or without a limit of time.
I humbly beg your Excellency to enter upon a verbal
discussion of this proposal. I shall have to submit the
result of our negotiations to my most gracious master
for approval. I entertain no doubt as to my being able
to obtain this sanction, if your Excellency be in a
position to agree in the name of the Emperor Francis
Joseph to the proposal made on our side, in the same
simple and general terms in which it is submitted. In
any case I shall consider myself fortunate if our conferences
lead to this or other results calculated to
promote the mutual interests of both Empires and the
peace of Europe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Letter from the King to Bismarck, dated Baden-Baden,
October 2nd, 1879: “I regret to see from your
letter of the 24th ultimo, as also from the memorandum
enclosed therewith, from the protocols of your negotiations
in Vienna, and from the draft treaty which has
been based upon them, that my views with regard
to the latter have not found acceptance on any side. As
I expressed these views in my letters from Danzig and
Stettin of the 10th and 12th ultimo as clearly as it was
possible for me to do, you can see for yourself how far
they differ from the results arrived at, so that there is
no necessity for me to repeat them. Notwithstanding
this circumstance, however, I return herewith your letter
of the 24th in order that you may form an idea
from my marginal notes (which, I regret to say, are only
in pencil) of the impression which it has made upon me.</p>

<p>“Germany and Austria are desirous of attaining the
same end&mdash;security against unprovoked attacks by
foreign foes. But owing to the special mention of
Russia as the foe in question, I cannot agree to the
present proposals nor to the immediate conclusion of a
treaty. After again extending the hand in friendship to
the Emperor Alexander after the removal of misunderstandings
(at Alexandrowo), am I now to conclude an
alliance against him, even of a defensive character, in
which he alone is referred to as the presumable aggressor,
and keep this intention a secret from him? I cannot be
guilty of such an act of disloyalty. In mitigation of
this objection it has been urged that, <i lang="fr" title="where applicable">le cas échéant</i>,
Russia would be informed of the existence of an
alliance, if indications of a war against us became
evident. This very uncertain expression is so elastic
that the notice would either come too late or would
only cause still greater irritation. It was further argued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span>
that in the state of ferment now prevailing in the
internal affairs of Russia the knowledge of the alliance
in question would give her the leverage and self-command
necessary to master that ferment. But surely
for that purpose official knowledge of that honourable
intention is necessary. And yet it is of course impossible
to give official knowledge of the fact that Russia is
regarded as the sole enemy. Therefore in order that it
may be possible to communicate the treaty to Russia, the
reference to her must be omitted from it, and the enemy
be only described in general terms, while it must be
incidentally mentioned that in entering upon it the
parties have this honourable intention in view. That is
what I desire. I am opposed to an immediate ratification
of the treaty, because there is at the present
moment absolutely nothing which could lead to a war
against Germany and Austria, and it is notorious that
binding treaties entered into without urgent necessity
are double-edged weapons. Austria urges the immediate
ratification on the ground that the favourable situation
which for the moment exists in France may be
endangered, and that the intimacy between Austria and
England may cool down. I cannot conceive how such
far-reaching political combinations can possibly be made
to depend upon the hazard of a Minister of the French
Republic who is on the point of being overthrown.
The Anglo-Austrian intimacy must after all be very
shaky if it depends upon the date of the ratification of
a treaty. In view of the consideration shown by
Austria for the susceptibilities of France and her
apprehensions as to a coolness with England, Milutin’s
opinion as to the possibility of a Triple Alliance may
after all not be entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>“Now, another circumstance has arisen which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span>
open a way out of the dilemma in which I find myself
between my conscience and honour so far as Russia is
concerned, and the objections raised to my views on the
Austrian side. In reply to my telegraphic inquiry,
you have informed me by wire of what Saburoff told
you under instructions from the Emperor. You infer
from these communications that Russia has already got
wind of our Austrian negotiations (as is quite natural),
and you wish to conclude from the defensive attitude,
which, according to Saburoff’s assurance, Russia intends
in future to maintain that this assurance must have been
a consequence of the knowledge obtained respecting our
negotiations. In these circumstances it might be
possible to immediately carry out the suggestion made
by me on page 3 as to the manner of communicating
our proposed arrangement with Austria, and to give the
treaty a general character, not only by omitting the
name of Russia, but by inviting her to join in the
treaty. You yourself have said to Saburoff that you
are thoroughly in favour of the maintenance of the
Three Emperors’ Alliance; and the same idea occurs in
the memorandum, the protocol, and the treaty. What,
then, could be simpler than to confirm in a real written
treaty the Drei Kaiser Bündniss which has hitherto
been merely verbal, or, at most, only had a written
basis in the St. Petersburg-Vienna arrangement? You
yourself have further told Saburoff that you would not
be able to co-operate in any policy by which Austria
would be endangered. It is as right as it is important
that Russia should thus receive the first official intimation
of that of which it has already got wind. Inasmuch
as our Ambassador at St. Petersburg will have informed
Minister Giers of your interview with Saburoff, I would
ask whether his assurance that Russia would henceforth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span>
only pursue a defensive policy based on the Treaty of
Berlin is authentic, and whether it signifies a defensive
policy as against Germany and Austria. If a satisfactory
answer were received, and this were immediately communicated
to Austria, there would be no further obstacle
in the way of ourselves and Austria acquainting the
Emperor Alexander in the manner above mentioned
(page 3) with the projected treaty, and inviting his
adhesion.</p>

<p>“This would render necessary a modification of
section 1; section 2 would drop out entirely; section 4
would be redrafted in accordance with my marginal
notes, should it be considered desirable that the draft
itself should constitute the first invitation to Russia to
join in the treaty, as the whole treaty would be submitted
as an instrument affecting so far only Germany
and Austria. I consider the omission of section 2 to
be necessary, because it is directed exclusively against
Russia; and furthermore because it is specially stated
in your letter of the 24th ultimo that in case of an
attack by France upon Germany, Austria would be dispensed
from supporting the latter, and only bound to
observe a benevolent neutrality. That is as much as to
say that we should support Austria against Russia with
our whole power (section 1), while Austria is dispensed
from rendering a like service if France should attack us.
But the latter eventuality is unquestionably more possible
and indeed more probable than a Russian attack, at
least up to the present, since there the desire for the
<i lang="fr">revanche</i> is only slumbering, has never been abandoned,
and will show itself again directly a suitable opportunity
arises. With regard to our&mdash;Germany’s&mdash;position
in a war with France I differ from Field-Marshal Moltke,
inasmuch as I cannot endorse his view that our forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span>
are sufficient to enable us to carry on such a war without
allies. In that event we should find ourselves in
presence of an army entirely different to that of 1870,
as the progress which it has made is undeniable.
Besides, there is a further consideration, namely, the
almost hermetically sealed French frontier, extending
from the Swiss to the Belgian frontiers, a continuous
line of fortresses and forts, which&mdash;even if broken
through&mdash;would render it impossible to send reinforcements
to the front, and would, moreover, enormously
hamper the strategic advance of our forces. It is on this
restricted field that, according to Field-Marshal Moltke,
we are to deliver battle. If we are victorious we cannot
pursue the defeated enemy as we did in 1870, being
stopped by this girdle of fortresses, to which, instead of
engaging in a pursuit, we should immediately have to
lay siege. Months might pass before we could capture
any of them, and this would give the defeated army
time to refit at its leisure behind this line and to meet
us well prepared in the event of our breaking through
it at the risk of our communications with our base.
But if the German army is defeated in the first battle
then the left bank of the Rhine is immediately lost and
we must withdraw across the river.</p>

<p>“For this reason Austria ought not to remain neutral
in such a war, but, on the contrary, must be bound by
treaty to support us with her whole power, in the same
way as the treaty binds us to do with regard to Russia.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Continuation of this Imperial communication to the
Chancellor, dated Baden, October 4th: “I had not
finished the enclosed letter to you yesterday when your
long telegram arrived, so that I had still to add the last
three-quarters of a page. The standpoint taken by me
in this letter has not been affected by my resolve to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span>
approve <em>conditionally</em> of the Vienna proposal. But I
again ask you what are we to reply if, in reference to
the Memorandum to be communicated to him, the Emperor
Alexander should ask: ‘What, then, have you
decided to do in connection with this Memorandum?
most probably concluded an agreement? Until I am
acquainted with it, I can come to no decision, therefore
show me this agreement.’ But as the agreement in its
present form cannot be shown to Russia, we must decline
to produce it; and what impression must this
refusal make upon the Emperor Alexander? Certainly
the very worst. The wording of section 2 is, to my
mind, so very strange that I merely wanted to sum up
the enclosure by proposing that the neutrality of Austria
in case of our being attacked by France be struck out,
and Austria be called upon to assume the same obligation
to stand by us with her entire strength that we undertake
towards Austria in section 1, in case of a Russian
attack. Otherwise the conditions are not equal. Strongly
impress this upon Andrassy once more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Letter from Andrassy to Bismarck, dated 3rd
October, 1879: “I have received your much esteemed
letter of the 29th of September, for which I return my
warmest thanks. I have since then received through
Prince Reuss some communications referring to the
position of the negotiations. I enclose them herewith in
the form in which they were written down by Prince
Reuss himself. I am in a position to declare myself in
agreement with the intention manifested in this proposal,
but I have nevertheless some scruples as to two
points. The first is that a treaty is spoken of, and the
second that the conclusion of the treaty is described as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>
impending <em>in the future</em>. My objection to the first is
that, if the intention to conclude a treaty is expressly
emphasised in the letter of his Majesty the Emperor
William, it follows necessarily that they will ask for the
text at St. Petersburg, and this will afford the Russian
Cabinet, before things are settled between us, an opportunity
to commence negotiations <i lang="fr" title="involving three parties">à trois</i> from which I
do not anticipate a satisfactory result for any of the
parties. For this reason I venture to submit a counter,
or, more correctly, a parallel proposal, the adoption of
which would, it seems to me, be of advantage to both
sides. This is:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>After having sanctioned the signature of the
Treaty</em> (underlined by Bismarck in pencil) his Majesty
the Emperor William can <em>communicate the entire contents</em>
(underlined in pencil by Bismarck) of the Memorandum
agreed upon and signed by us, which, of course,
implies an agreement, adding on his own part the
explanation that this agreement at the same time involves
a tacit understanding by both Governments that
an attack upon either Empire will be regarded as
directed against both, and will also be construed by his
Majesty in that sense. His Majesty, satisfied with the
statement made by Saburoff, respecting Russia’s love of
peace, makes this communication as a proof of his
loyalty and frankness. His Majesty may, perhaps, add
that this understanding is of an entirely defensive
character, and that there is nothing to prevent Russia
from removing any antagonistic tendency by herself
adhering to the principles laid down in the Memorandum.
(Pencil-marked in the margin by Bismarck.) By
this means the object of the Emperor William would be
fully attained, namely, to communicate the significance
of our understanding, while, on the other hand, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span>
mention would be made of the existence of a more
precise agreement, and, therefore, the necessity of communicating
it would be avoided.</p>

<p>“Such a communication of the text would have
among other things the disadvantage, first, that the
adhesion of Russia to this text is inconceivable; secondly,
that the passage in it referring to France and Italy
would become known there almost immediately, and
would, at the present time, give rise to quite unnecessary
combinations; and, thirdly, that the affair might
transpire in Parliament, and lead to undesirable discussions.
These considerations commend my proposal.
Should you not be able to secure its acceptance in the
competent quarter, I could agree to any other method,
including the suggestion made by Stolberg, my most
gracious master having before his departure declared
that he would not make a <i lang="la" title="essential condition">conditio sine quâ non</i> of
preserving secrecy as to the Treaty <em>after signature</em>.</p>

<p>“There is, on the other hand, one point which I
would regard as entirely out of the question, namely,
any communication of the existence and contents of
the Treaty before the sanction of his Majesty, the
Emperor William, is actually given or is assured.
(Bismarck added in pencil: ‘Quite right.’) Without
desiring to forestall the decision upon this point of my
most gracious master, I should prefer to <em>renounce
altogether the conclusion of an agreement</em>, and in any
case I should be obliged to forego for my own part any
further share in the negotiations upon such basis.
Pray excuse, dear Prince, the somewhat abrupt tone
of this statement, but as the matter appeared to me to
be pressing, I desired to let Prince Reuss have the
letter to-day. Begging you to present my respects to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span>
the Princess, I remain, with unalterable and cordial
respect,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Crown Prince writes to Bismarck (quite confidentially)
from Baden-Baden, on the 4th of October,
1879: “Count Stolberg will have already informed you
prior to the receipt of these lines of the course of
affairs up to the signing of the draft Treaty by the
Emperor. I therefore say nothing more about this
very exciting crisis, the result of which I confidently
anticipate will be of far-reaching importance for the
position of Germany. I must point out, however, that
his Majesty is quite miserable, and keeps on repeating
that he has dishonoured himself by his decision, and has
been disloyal to his friend the Tsar; so that one clearly
sees how fearfully difficult the decision was for him,
with his extreme conscientiousness.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Draft (dated Varzin, October 30th, 1879) of a
verbal answer to be made to the Emperor Alexander in
reply to any question which he might ultimately put:
“An institution which arose under the influence of
Alexander <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> and which preserved the peace of central
Europe for half a century, had to be sacrificed in 1866
to irresistible necessity. The German Confederation
was an excessive burden to us Prussians, while it did
not satisfy the aspirations of the other Germans. The
discontent thus created was utilised by the revolutionary
party, for the purpose of threatening every German
Prince. It was necessary to deprive them of this
weapon, and to satisfy the national sentiment. This
was done at the expense of the security which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span>
Confederation afforded, almost without cost, to its
weaker members.</p>

<p>“That the breach caused by the secession of Austria,
which extended from the Carpathians to the Lake of
Constance, would have to be filled up was recognised
even in the <i lang="de">Paulskirche</i>. Later on, after the war of
1866, attempts were unceasingly made to bind Austria
to the States, with which it had been formerly united in
the German Confederation, so as to prevent her from
allying herself with France against them. This object
has now been attained without any obligation on our
part to defend Trient, Trieste, or, indeed, Bosnia,
against Italians, or Turks, or Southern Slavs. Our
agreement with Austria no more involves anything in
the nature of a threat to our neighbours than would
do the erection of a fortress on the frontier, which, of
course, has never been regarded in that light, and it is
even less of a menace for instance, than the construction
of strategic railways. It has, indeed, the character of
a mutual assurance society, which every one having
similar interests is at liberty to join.”</p>
</div>

<p>Report of the Emperor William to Bismarck of his
interview at Alexandrowo, from a copy made for the
Crown Prince:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. <i>September 5th.</i>&mdash;“The Emperor Alexander
began the conversation by an explanation of his letter
to me. Nobody knew anything of it.” (Marginal note
by Bismarck: “Gortschakoff revised it.”) (1) He had
shown it to no one <em>before</em> it was despatched, and <em>after</em>
it had been sent he only communicated it verbally
without naming the persons. If, therefore, I had found
anything offensive in the letter, as he saw from my
answer, he alone was to blame, and he recognised that
it was possible for me to have misunderstood him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span>
(2) He was <em>very sorry</em> for that, and since it had had
such a serious result as to cause me personal offence, he
wished it to be regarded as if it had never been written.
Nothing was farther from his intention than the idea of
a threat. He had only wished to call my attention to
the fact, which was perfectly true, that if the press of
both countries continued to rail at each other it must
lead in the course of time to a feeling of hostility
between the two States, and his sole object was to avoid
that. (3) He considered that the preservation of the
peace of Europe was only possible in the future, as it
had been in the past, so long as good relations between
Prussia and Russia were maintained under all circumstances.
(3<span class="allsmcap">A</span>) The votes given, mostly against Russia,
by my Commissioners in the proceedings of the European
Commissions in the East had betrayed a hostile attitude
on the part of Germany towards Russia, which had
caused great irritation in the latter country, and gave
rise to the excited comments of the press. (4) In these
Commissions Russia was pursuing the object which she
had had exclusively in view during the war, namely, to
improve and render more assured the fate of the
Christian populations, but not to make conquests. If
opposition were now offered thereto in the delimitation
of the frontier, and more or more Christians were
restored against his wish to Turkish sovereignty,
the Commissioners must have received instructions to
that effect. (5) The German votes had already produced
a bad effect in Turkey also, inasmuch as the
disagreement which was there seen to exist between Germany
and Russia rendered the Turks more obstinate, and
caused work to drag on interminably. (6) Prince
Bismarck, whom he had hitherto known only as the
friend of the Russo-Prussian relations, seemed unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span>
forget Prince Gortschakoff’s&mdash;stupid&mdash;circular of 1875.
<em>He</em> had strongly advised Prince Gortschakoff <em>against
sending this circular</em>, and pointed out to him the evil
consequences (of his vanity, <i lang="fr" title="in parentheses">en parenthese</i>) because if
there actually were anything to smooth over, that was
not the way to set about it. Prince Gortschakoff had
his way, however. Bismarck’s grudge, and his inability
to forget, which began with this irritation against
Gortschakoff, appeared to him to have been transferred
to Russia, and it was to this that he referred in his
letter to me when he said that he could not reconcile
such conduct with the character of so eminent a statesman.
This expression of his in the letter to me did not
refer to the instructions given to the Commissioners
with respect to Eastern affairs. Moreover (7), Prince
Gortschakoff is a man who has outlived his usefulness,
and whom he hardly ever consults now. “In reply to
No. 1, I said I could not deny that I had been painfully
affected by his letter, particularly because I had considered
that his remarks referred only to the votes in
question, and they seemed to me a matter of such slight
consequence that I could not understand his irritation
on that score. It was only through his declaration to
the effect that his expression referred to the subject
dealt with in No. 7 (doubtless No. 6 is meant) that I
now for the first time understood it. I could assure him
that Prince Bismarck still regards the relations between
Prussia, Germany, and Russia as he always did, but
that he saw a feeling gaining ground in Russia, chiefly
owing to the press, which he could not understand,
in view of the existing laws there, especially
as semi-official organs contributed to this
detrimental state of feeling. I added that I
was prepared to admit that our press was also
guilty of similar excesses, but, after all, these were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span>
mainly in self-defence against the Russian attacks.
We are so tied by our press laws that we can
only intervene in the way of personal <em>appeal</em> to the
editors of the newspapers, but not legally unless a state
of siege were proclaimed in certain districts. Nos. 2
and 3. If the words in question were to be understood
as containing no threat I should feel reassured, as the
interpretation which the Emperor gave to this passage
of his letter was in perfect accord with my own convictions.
As his Government had quite recently issued
a serious reprimand with regard to improper articles in
the newspapers, it was to be expected and hoped, from the
power with which the Governor-General was invested,
that energetic action would be taken. I, on my part,
had caused certain <em>advice</em> to be given to the editors, the
law did not <em>permit</em> any more. 3<span class="allsmcap">A</span>. Our instructions to
the Commissioners in question had remained the same
from the very beginning: if Russia and Austria were
in agreement always to vote with them; when points
arose where that was not the case to vote with the
majority, where the Russian proposal was not flagrantly
untenable. That had been the case in the matter of
Silistria, where I was entirely in favour of the Russian
proposal to appoint a Commission to inquire into the
question of the bridge on the spot, and also with
regard to the military road through Eastern Rumelia.
4. This view was quite new to me, as nothing of the
kind had previously been brought to my notice. At
the same time, these little frontier details were after all
so trifling that they could hardly affect the question of
the Christians to any important extent. Unfortunately,
the Greek frontier question had only been mentioned at
the Congress as the expression of a desire, and not as a
<em>demand</em>, and I foresaw, from the first, how it would
be, <i lang="fr" title="but I was unable to have my say in the Congress">mais pendant le congrès je n’avais pas voix au<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span>
chapitre</i>. I regarded in the same way the Jewish
question in Rumania, the broader solution desired being,
to my mind, impracticable, and therefore I wished to
see the Greek modification adopted.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Continuation of this report, dated September 12th,
1879:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Nos. 6 and 7. I had never noticed that Prince
Bismarck was inspired by particularly hostile feelings
towards Prince Gortschakoff on account of the latter’s
circular of 1875. My opinion and his upon that note
was exactly the same as that of the Emperor Alexander
himself; but at the Berlin Congress the same view with
regard to Prince Gortschakoff was manifested as was expressed
above by the Emperor, and I therefore understood
the peculiar position which was now assigned to him.
I believe that in my answer to the Emperor I adequately
emphasised how little change there has been in Prince
Bismarck’s political views so far as Russia is concerned.
He had always agreed with me that, remembering the
attitude adopted by Russia towards us in 1870, we for
two whole years, 1876 and 1877, tried to manifest our
gratitude to the Emperor by our <i lang="fr" title="benevolent neutrality">neutralité bienveillante</i>,
and actually succeeded in preventing a coalition of the
Western Powers, including Austria. This seemed to me
to disprove the suspicion of the Emperor that Prince
Bismarck had out of spite against Prince Gortschakoff
changed his political views, and on that account had
adopted towards Russia an attitude to which expression
had been given in such trifling questions. Up to the
present Prince Bismarck’s sentiments towards Russia
remained unaltered.</p>

<p>“On the forenoon of the 4th the Emperor came to
see me again in order to take leave of me after lunch.
He had received a telegram from Jugenheim, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span>
Empress Marie, who desired to be remembered to me,
and was very pleased at our meeting at Alexandrowo.
He added: ‘<span lang="fr"><a id="TN8A"></a>C’est à elle que j’ai communiqué la
première ma lettre à Vous dont le brouillon était par
differentes correctures presque illisible</span>. I afterwards
showed my letter and your answer to Adlerberg,
Milutin and Giers; they know exactly what my political
opinions are concerning Prussia and Germany, and being
in perfect agreement with me on this subject, they are
pleased that erroneous impressions will be dispelled by
our meeting.’ The Emperor then read me a letter from
the Russian envoy reporting a conversation which he
had had at Kissingen with Prince Bismarck on the
political situation; and a great deal had in particular
been said about Prussia and Russia acting together.
The envoy found that Prince Bismarck’s former view of
the Three Emperors’ Alliance had remained entirely unchanged.
The Emperor repeated, <i lang="fr" title="as an overview">en aperçu</i>, the views
which we had exchanged, and was heartily glad the
misunderstandings had been cleared up and that the
old friendship would be maintained between the two
States in association with Austria. As to the latter,
he now added for the first time: ‘Certainly I had reason
to be dissatisfied with her, as her attitude towards me
during the war was <i lang="fr" title="suspicious">louche</i> as usual. Without firing a
shot she occupied two Turkish provinces, of course
never to surrender them again, as the English will never
give up Cyprus, respecting which they entered into a
separate treaty during the Congress without making any
communication to the Great Powers.’ I interrupted him
here, saying I believed there had been negotiations at
Reichstadt respecting the occupation of Bosnia and the
Herzegovina. ‘Yes,’ said the Emperor, ‘but under
quite different conditions, that Austria should take part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span>
in the war in some way or other. All the same, the
main point is that we should hold together <i lang="fr" title="the three of us">à trois</i>.’ Of
course I could only confirm that view as my own conviction.</p>

<p>“On the same morning I spoke to General Count
Adlerberg, Minister Giers, and Minister of War Milutin,
one after the other. The first two spoke with equal
warmth in favour of the old relations. They were aware
of the Emperor’s letter and of my answer, which I
mentioned as <i lang="fr" title="a conversation starter">entrée de conversation</i>, and they were at
one with the Emperor in his satisfaction at the removal
of the misunderstandings which they would have
thought to be impossible, knowing, as they did, exactly
the views to which the Emperor desired to give expression
in his letter. I have no reason to doubt the
sincerity of these sentiments. I nevertheless told them
quite plainly that it was the press that led to an
estrangement between our countries. As a strongly
worded rescript had now been issued in Russia decidedly
disapproving of the hostile attitude adopted by the press
towards Germany, an improvement was to be anticipated,
that is, if the Governors by whom a state of siege had
been proclaimed throughout almost all Russia&mdash;a
measure to which I could only wish every success&mdash;made
use of their power to immediately seize all newspapers,
pamphlets, &amp;c., which published inflammatory
matter. If that were not done the dangerous consequences
which the Emperor had foreseen would
certainly follow, namely, discord between the two
States. In dealing with our own free press, my hands
were tied by the law and our representative Constitution,
and hence the defensive attitude against the Russian
press taken up in our newspaper articles. I had, however,
given orders that the editors should be advised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span>
exercise greater restraint themselves, should an improvement
take place in the Russian press. The
gentlemen in question agreed with me in all this, and
hoped for an improvement.</p>

<p>“The conversation with General Milutin began with
the subject described above. I then expressed my
appreciation of the new organisation introduced during
the war, and said I could not understand where the
money was found for it. But all Europe had been
alarmed at seeing the efforts and the monetary sacrifices
made for carrying on the war suddenly retained on a
peace footing. He replied: ‘It was precisely the war
which proved that the Russian army was not strong
enough even to overcome the power of Turkey, its enormous
forces being dispersed over the whole empire from
Siberia to the Vistula. Therefore a nucleus must be
maintained which shall be equal to European requirements.
This cost can be met out of Russian resources
that are unknown to other countries. We have war
frontiers against China, against the countries on
the Indian border, against Persia and against
Turkey. We have received news that a coalition is
being formed between Austria, England, and perhaps
France. That points to a new conflict in the East.
England is organising and arming Asia Minor, which is
being inundated with State officials, generals, and
officers in the guise of consuls, a sure indication of
hostile intentions upon our position in the Caucasus.
The Eastern conflict is near at hand.’ I demurred to
the latter statement, and asserted that if once the
decisions of the Berlin Congress were carried out in
their entirety, no fresh war was to be anticipated there,
as Turkey required peace above everything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span></p>

<p>“While the Emperor was with me on the 4th a
telegram from London was brought to him, according to
which England declared that, although not in favour of
the appointment of a technical commission <i lang="la">ad hoc</i> for
the settlement of the bridge question at Silistria, she
would be pleased to see the Servian Frontier Commission
entrusted with that task. The Emperor said he could
agree to that, and that only technical members should
be appointed to the Commission.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>These papers also include the letter from the Emperor
William to Bismarck, dated 10/9/79, which accompanied
the foregoing report: “Herewith I send you the conclusion
of the notes of my conversation with the
Emperor Alexander. My letter from Berlin, which
crossed your memorandum No. 1, showed you that your
views, which you now repeat with more detail in No. 2,
are in contradiction&mdash;first in principle, and then that an
answer could not be given until I had spoken with the
Emperor Alexander. Your premises in the memoranda
could be transformed into truth for me only after I had
spoken to the Emperor, and&mdash;as I wrote you through
Minister von Bülow&mdash;after light had been thrown upon
the correspondence. Up to that time I regarded your
memoranda <i lang="fr" title="as if they had not been written">comme non avenus</i>. For me my notes have
brought this light. The Emperor regrets having written
the letter, as it has given rise to misunderstandings; as
the words ‘ce qui doit avoir des suites fâcheuses et
dangereuses’ should absolutely not be regarded as
threatening a rupture, but only as directing my attention
to the fact that if some restraint were not placed upon
the press, ill feeling might arise between our two
countries, which neither of us desired, and therefore that
measures should be taken accordingly. That being as
true as anything in this world can be, I could only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span>
express my complete approval, all the more so as the
Russian Government had already taken such steps, and
I had ordered similar measures prior to my departure.
As you will see from the notes, I corrected the view
taken by the Emperor Alexander of the votes given by
my Commissioners in the East, and he fully understood
this, although he stated that he had already received
news of the unfavourable consequences of these votes,
which was quite new to me, but which explained the
Emperor’s dissatisfaction on that score. You will also
read how I defended you against the passage in the
Emperor’s letter. He fully agreed that our policy
during the war in the East was of the greatest benefit
to Russia, which involves the highest recognition for
yourself. I could assure him that <em>till now</em> you had
maintained your old sentiments towards Russia, as was
sufficiently proved in 1877 and 1878. On this occasion
the Emperor expressed his conviction that peace could
only be preserved for Europe by our holding together
<i lang="fr" title="the three of us">à trois</i>, as we had done since the meeting in Berlin in
1872. Having hitherto held the same conviction myself,
I could only agree with him. As the three persons,
Adlerberg, Giers, and Milutin, spoke in exactly the same
sense, the light which I looked for at this meeting at
Alexandrowo respecting the sentiments of the Emperor
and those persons who stand highest in his confidence
has been forthcoming <em>so far as I am concerned</em>. None
of them has the slightest wish to wage war upon us.
The great additions to the Russian army which were
raised as a reserve during the Turkish war, are retained
as a permanent increase because they believe themselves
to be threatened by a European coalition, and therefore
must be in a state of preparation which would enable
them to meet this <em>alone</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span></p>

<p>“Since therefore, for me, the premises in your
memoranda fall to the ground, namely, that owing to
the danger threatened from Russia we should give up
the policy we have hitherto pursued in our relations
with that country and not only seek but actually conclude
a European coalition of a defensive nature against
Russia, I cannot lend myself to this project in its
present extension. In view of the explanation given
by the Emperor Alexander of his letter to me, which <em>I</em>
originally did not regard as a threat but only as a desire
to see the existing good relations between our States
maintained by means of restrictions upon the press, it
could <em>only be a source of satisfaction to me</em> to see the
milder tone which prevailed in your answer sent by me
to the Emperor, the moderate pressure and the truths
which it contained being sufficiently intelligible <em>and also
understood</em>. The words ‘une entente séculaire, les
legs de nos pères de glorieuse mémoire’ were written
according to my own heart, and went to the heart of the
Emperor, so that he repeated them to me twice. I
could not therefore understand your hostility to
Russia, which increases with each memorandum, nor
could I see how the expressions quoted above could be
interpreted as a mere empty phrase! I was just as
deeply affected by the words that we should outwardly
maintain a friendly attitude towards Russia while at
the same time concluding a coalition against her with
Austria, with England, and perhaps with France.
And you have its conclusion already so fixedly
in view that you have not only communicated your
whole project to Count Andrassy, but have also permitted
him to speak of it to his Emperor (seinem
Kaiser), who also immediately accepts it. Then you
invite me to send you instructions, on your way back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span>
through Vienna, to conclude a defensive alliance there
with Austria against Russia, which would be followed
by the larger coalition. Put yourself in my place for
a moment. I am in presence of a personal friend, a
near relative and an ally, in order to come to an understanding
as to some hasty and indeed misunderstood
passages in a letter, and our interview leads to a
satisfactory result. Shall I now at the same time join a
hostile coalition against this sovereign, that is to say, act
behind his back in a manner contrary to that in which
I spoke to him?</p>

<p>“I will not absolutely deny that the dangers set
forth in your memoranda may arise one day, particularly
on a change of rulers in St. Petersburg. I am, however,
utterly unable to see that there is any imminent
danger. How often have you warned me against
treaties with other Powers, which tied one’s hands, when
there is no positive object in view, and there is only
room for conjecture as to an uncertain future. My
brother and Minister Manteuffel in particular burnt
their fingers over the Three Years’ Treaty with Austria
which was concluded after Olmütz, and impatiently
awaited the expiry of that term. The present case is
quite similar. It is against my political convictions
and my conscience to bind my hands for the sake of a
<em>possible eventuality</em>.</p>

<p>“At the same time, I must not disavow you and the
steps which you have already taken in dealing with
Andrassy and his master. Therefore in Vienna,
whither all the newspapers already say you are going, you
may speak of the <em>eventuality</em> of disagreement with
Russia developing into a possible breach, and enter
into <i lang="fr" title="talks">pourparlers</i> respecting the joint measures to be
then taken with Austria. But, following my conscience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span>
I do not authorise you to conclude a convention, to say
nothing of a treaty.</p>

<p>“In this way I hope our views will again agree. If
it be God’s will that this should be the case, I can look
forward with confidence to the future, which would
otherwise for me be very dark, and anticipate a genuine
continuance of the relations with Russia, which are
growing more friendly. I cannot tell you how painful
the episode has been to me, when it seemed, for the first
time in seventeen years, as if we could not come to an
understanding. I impatiently await your answer to the
above authorisation, and am convinced that we shall be
able to come to an agreement. God grant that it may
be so!</p>

<p>Letter from Bismarck to Prince Reuss, dated Varzin,
28th January 1880 (on the left top corner, the note:
“Copied a second time in the interest of history”&mdash;doubtless
in Holstein’s handwriting):&mdash;</p>

<p>“In connection with your report, No. 11 of the
10th, I take the liberty to send your Serene Highness
a few words confidentially, and only for your personal
information, on the relations between Austria and
Italy.</p>

<p>“I consider it natural that Baron Haymerle should
have made no official complaint respecting Urezzana,
and furthermore, that he was tactically right in taking
that course. I should not regard it as good policy however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span>
to adopt a purely passive attitude towards similar
permanent threats. Such a course would, I fear, only
encourage Italian Chauvinism, and the semi-complicity
of the Government therewith. According to my political
convictions a purely defensive attitude, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>, one of mere
complaint, is not an effective weapon against such
permanent threats or incitement. It is open to Austria
to parry such attacks, by assuming the offensive, on
similar lines to the Italian demonstrations. It is not
the Italian Government which adopts a threatening
attitude. It only suffers Italian subjects to do so. Now
I am convinced that there are elements and movements
in Austria that favour the restoration of the Papal
States, and of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, just as
the Irredentists work for the acquisition of the Trentino.
If these elements in the press and public life of Austria
were to come or to be drawn into greater prominence,
that would involve a counteraction against the Irredenta,
which would compel the Italians to fall back upon the
defensive, without being able to make any complaint.
Even the plea that Austria, in view of such threatening
movements, requires a better line of defence than that
which she now possesses would be quite as legitimate as
a craving for the Trentino, Trieste, and Dalmatia. Italy
by herself would scarcely venture to attack Austria, but
her present attitude is a constant encouragement to the
war party in Russia. For about twelve months I have
had the impression that Italy is inclined to place herself
at the disposal of a Russian policy of war if in return
she were offered an accession of territory and a stretch
of the Adriatic coast. The relations which it has been
sought to establish between the two armies, the Italian
and the Russian, and the shifting of the centre of gravity
of the Italian army towards the north support this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span>
impression, not less than the indications furnished by
various votes which the Great Powers have respectively
given. This whole attitude shows that Italy must
not be numbered to-day among the peace-loving and
conservative Powers, who must reckon with this fact. I
beg your Serene Highness also to think over this matter
for yourself, and to kindly send me your views in an
autograph private letter. Of course any initiative in
opening up this subject must be carefully avoided, but
Baron Haymerle, or Count Andrassy when he comes to
Vienna, can hardly fail to bring it up in conversation
with your Serene Highness, and thus give you an
opportunity of introducing observations in the sense of
the foregoing remarks, not as the expression of German
policy, but as your own opinion in the character of a
friendly expert. In certain circumstances the Nuncio
also might afford an opportunity for an expression of
opinion in this sense which would excite no suspicion.
It would in any case be of interest to assure one’s self
of the present feelings of the Italian Prelacy with regard
to strategic moves of this description.</p>

<p>“I cannot deny that, to my mind, the Italy of to-day
offers Germany small prospect of useful co-operation
with us in the possible crises of the future. On the
contrary, we have much more ground to fear that Italy
will join our adversaries than to hope that she will
unite with us, seeing that we have no more inducements
to offer her. Every encouragement to Italian policy
to join the bellicose and predatory Powers in Europe
is contrary to <em>German</em> interests, and in the present
instance still more contrary to those of Austria. For
the protection of the latter it would, I think, be useful
to call the attention of the English Cabinet to the encouragement
to breaches of the peace which the attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span>
of Italy involves. Perhaps your Serene Highness can
ascertain whether anything has been done or is intended
in this direction.</p>

excuse me for selecting this method of answering them,
but you know how badly I write long explanations, and

you at the same time that I consider the moment has

was all along intended to acquaint him, as to the utter
inexpediency, now no less than formerly, of the marriage
in question, which, of course, he himself has also always
held to be impossible. Now, however, that Prince
Alexander has come forward as a rebel against the peace
of Paris (doubtless Berlin was meant), and the signatories
thereto, whether he remains in Bulgaria or not, a marriage
of this kind has become more than ever impossible.

<p>I left for Hamburg at 12.20 on the 29th of October,
shortly after the Emperor passed through that city.
On the evening of the 30th I returned to Friedrichsruh,
where I arrived about 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> At dinner, the Prince,
who was in excellent spirits, said that the most gracious
Master had in all taken up five hours of his time.
Afterwards, over our coffee, he observed to me: “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span>
afternoon he let me talk to him for three hours on end.
I stood as if in the pulpit, and I am tired out.” Everybody
said that the Emperor was extremely unaffected
and amiable, and the Princess noticed in particular that
he could laugh most heartily. I heard that Minister
Mittnacht would arrive next day. By 12 o’clock on the
day of my journey to Hamburg I had read through the
last of the Bismarck papers, which went as far as the
year 1887 and concluded with No. 735. Among the
most recent of the papers are three letters of the year
1880 from King Lewis of Bavaria, full of recognition
for Bismarck, the second expressing regret at his wish
to retire, and the hope that he would remain. A letter
from the Emperor William to the Chief dated May 31,
1886, on the “horrifying news from Munich,” says
towards the close that there is little to be hoped from
Prince Luitpold, while King Lewis is credited with
having “shown more good will ... for the German
cause.” Then two autograph letters from the Crown
Princess (the present Dowager Empress). One is dated
December 23, 1885, and accompanied a present of
Moselle wine which he had liked at her table; while
the other, dated from Villa Zivio, November 22, 1887,
deals with the illness of her consort, and reports the
unanimous opinion of the German doctors. Finally, a
letter of November 23, 1887, from the Emperor
William, which is very illegibly written and runs somewhat
as follows: “Enclosed I send you the nomination
of your son as <i lang="de" title="full Privy Councillor">Wirklicher Geheimrath</i> with the title of
Excellency, in order that you may hand it to him,
a pleasure which I would not deny you. I imagine that
this pleasure will be threefold, for yourself, for your son,
and for me! I take this opportunity (to explain) to
you the silence which I have observed up to the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span>
respecting your proposal, in view of the sad condition of
health of my son the Crown Prince, to initiate my
grandson, Prince William, more fully into State affairs.
In principle I entirely agree with you that this must be
done, but it is a very difficult matter to carry into
execution. You will of course know that the very
natural decision, which I took on your advice, that, in
case of my being prevented, my grandson William should
sign the current Cabinet rescripts in civil and military
affairs with the superscription ‘By Order of his
Majesty’ greatly irritated the Crown Prince, as if, in
Berlin, a substitute were already being thought of. On
considering the matter quietly my son will doubtless
have reassured himself. But such reflection would be
more difficult if he ascertained that his son were allowed
a still greater insight into State affairs, and were even
given a Civil aide-de-camp as I used to call my
<i lang="de">Vortragende Räthe</i>. Things were, however, quite
(different) then. As there was nothing that could
induce my Royal father to appoint a substitute for the
then Crown Prince (although my succession to the
throne could be anticipated long beforehand), my introduction
to State affairs was put off till I was forty-four
years old, when my brother suddenly nominated me
a member of the Ministry of State with the title of
Prince of Prussia. It was necessary in this position
that an experienced man of business should be appointed
to prepare me for each sitting of the Council of Ministers.
At the same time I received the diplomatic despatches
every day, after they had passed through four, five, or
six hands&mdash;according to the seals! A mere <em>conversation</em>,
such as you propose, the appointment of a statesman in
attendance on my grandson, would not have the
character of a preparation, as in my case, for a <em>specific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>
object</em>, and would certainly still further irritate my son,
a thing which must absolutely be avoided. I would
therefore suggest that the course of occupation hitherto
followed&mdash;learning the manner of dealing with State
affairs&mdash;should be continued, that is to say that (my
grandson) should be attached to single Ministries or
perhaps to two at a time, as during this winter, when
my grandson was attached in a voluntary capacity to
the Foreign Office as well as to the Ministry of Finance.
This voluntary course should cease with the New Year,
and perhaps (be replaced) by the Ministry of the Interior,
my grandson being permitted in special cases to obtain
information at the Foreign Office. This <em>continuation</em> of
the course hitherto followed may cause my son less
irritation, although you will remember that he was
strongly opposed even to this. I therefore beg you to
let me have your opinion on the matter. Wishing you
all a pleasant festival,</p>

<p>On Thursday, November 1st, I told the Prince, at
lunch, that I would either immediately or next morning
return him the papers, sorted and arranged. He replied,
however, that he had found some more which belonged
to the collection. He took me with him to his study,
and handed them to me for arrangement, adding that
there were very many more at Varzin, a whole box full,
including private letters of historic significance. I
should also go through these later on, and put them
into chronological order.</p>

<p>On the morning of Friday, the 2nd of November, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span>
read, sorted, and numbered new documents, which were
afterwards put into a fresh envelope. Among these
was the announcement of March, 1877, by the Emperor
William, that he had appointed Bismarck Hereditary
Grand Huntsman of Pomerania, reports respecting the
illness of the Crown Prince, afterwards Emperor
Frederick, from San Remo, Charlottenburg, and Potsdam,
a letter from the Emperor William <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> to Bismarck,
transferring him to the second regiment of Guards, a
telegram from the same, dated October 21, 1888,
expressing his satisfaction at his journey to South
Germany, Vienna, and Rome, whence he had just
returned, and his thanks for the Chief’s counsels, which
had been justified by his experience while away, and,
finally, the letter already alluded to from the Empress
Augusta. Nothing of importance among them.</p>

<p>At midday, before lunch, I personally handed over
to the Chief the envelopes containing the papers. He
appeared to have looked through them in the afternoon,
as, when he was passing by in the evening, before
dinner, as usual, with his two dogs, he gave me his
hand and thanked me, expressing his surprise that I
had been able to deal with such a mass of letters and
papers in so short a time. I said if he wished to
have those at Varzin also arranged, and could find no
more suitable person to do it, I should be glad if he
would let me know when he was next going to his estate
in Further Pomerania, so that I might come there and
complete my task. I should be delighted to serve him
and learn something for myself at the same time.
Rottenburg was absent from dinner. He had gone to
Hamburg to meet some relatives. During dinner there
was some talk of a Herr von Bülow, who had been the
Chief’s guest at lunch. I ascertained that in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span>
gentleman I had had before me the famous leader of the
Lauenburg nobility, to whom Bismarck had clearly
explained his standpoint, first on the Ratzeburg Lake,
and again on taking the oath of allegiance in the church
there. He is much more harmless than I had fancied
him. The Chief said: “I should have invited him to
remain to dinner, and he doubtless expected it, but he is
so tedious that I did not know what to do with him
during the five hours before dinner.” Then, after
referring to the letters of the Crown Prince in 1863,
which I had arranged, and to his own pencil notes, he
came to speak of the Crown Prince himself. I said:
“Absalom! And from what you wrote on the back
you doubtless wrote him in reply that you did not
intend to be ever included among his Ministers.”
“Yes,” he rejoined, and the quotation <i lang="de">Leicht fertig ist
die Jugend mit dem Wort</i>! (Youth is hasty in its
judgments). He then gave a survey of the various
phases of the Crown Prince’s attitude towards himself
in the course of his life. “First, in 1848 or 1849. At
that time he was still very thin and lanky. He showed
great attachment to me, and, when they forbade him to
do so at Potsdam, he used to try to meet me in the
dusk of the evening and shake hands with me. Then
the rude letter of 1863; afterwards, since 1864, in
Flensburg, better. Then again Liberal counsels,
Augustenburg sympathies, the Geffcken and Friedberg
introductions, and his siding with Cumberland.” I
said: “The Englishwoman, the Guelph.” We then
spoke of the latter, also over our coffee, when the
Princess said she could be very amiable when she liked,
as she herself had experienced; a statement which the
Chief also confirmed from his own experience. (...)</p>

<p>On Saturday I took leave of the Prince and Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>
in the dining-room, after I had fulfilled my promise to
the little Rantzaus to go with them to see a “house”
that they had begun to build on the roadside leading
to Dassendorf. I suggested some architectural improvements,
and the eldest one, with childlike politeness,
thanked me for the “good advice I had given
them,” and hoped I would soon come back again. A
prospect of doing so was held out to me on my taking
leave at the house. The Chief said, as he was shaking
hands: “Adieu, Büschlein, perhaps we shall resume
our business soon at Varzin. But I must first return
to Berlin.” The Princess asked me to present her
compliments to Bucher, and the Countess came down
to accompany me to the station with her children.
But first she showed me the handsome clock and
writing-table presented to her father by the German
manufacturers, and gave me a porcelain penholder
from one of the drawers as a souvenir.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 10th of February, 1889, I received
through a Chancery attendant an appointment to call
upon the Chief at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I appeared punctually at the
hour named, in his antechamber. Minister Bötticher
was called into the Prince before me, and I talked
to Rottenburg until my turn came. On entering
the room I found the Prince in uniform. He asked
about my health, and I inquired as to his. He complained
of insomnia, and said he could no longer get
any sleep without artificial means. On his then asking
me what I had been doing in the interval, I mentioned
the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> article on his attitude and that of the
Crown Prince at the Versailles negotiations with the
Bavarians, and he expressed a wish to see it, and said:
“I should like you to add something to it, and to return
to Geffcken’s extracts from the diary of the Crown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span>
Prince, or more correctly from one of the three or four
diaries of the war, and of later years. A diary is a
series of daily notes in which one writes down immediately
afterwards what he has ascertained and
experienced, just as a tourist does; and that too is the
character of the first original diary. It is short, and
as was natural enough in war time, it deals mainly with
military affairs, and contains scarcely any political
considerations. The others are interpolated later, from
conversations which he had with good friends, or those
whom he considered to be such&mdash;Geffcken, Roggenbach,
&amp;c. Thus he imagined that he had thought of all
these things himself, as far back as 1870. English
letters and influences will also have affected him. I say
he imagined that and believed it, because he was a man
who was very devoted to the truth. The good friends
were malcontents, ambitious place hunters, and intriguers,
people who felt that they had a vocation for
great things, who knew more and could do better than
the Government, and who would very willingly have
lent a hand if they had only been allowed to do so.
They were men of unappreciated talent, the wallflowers,
the pettifogging attorneys and quacks of politics. He
showed them the diary, and they made their observations
upon it, which he then inserted. They found that
in this shape it would come in usefully in the future. That
accounts for the various transformations it underwent.
The Crown Prince, like all mediocrities, liked copying,
and other occupations of the same sort, such as sealing
letters, &amp;c. And he had time enough for it, as the
King kept him apart from almost all political work,
seldom or never spoke to him on such matters, and
would not allow me to make any communication
to him on subjects of the kind. From 1863 onward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span>
there was an uninterrupted struggle between the two,
in the course of which there were several violent scenes
when the Crown Prince was pulled up sharply, and he
(imitating the gesture) cast up his eyes and raised his
hands in despair. It was the same at Versailles in connection
with the Emperor question, where the most
gracious Master would not at first hear a word of our proposals,
and got so angry on one occasion that he brought
down his fist violently upon the table and the inkstand
nearly flew out of the window. And here you may
supplement the report in the diary as to this incident.
Fragmentary and incomplete in every respect, it leaves
out the first act in the negotiations, in which I had to
wean the Crown Prince of the notion, which doubtless
originated at Baden, that the Emperor idea was un-German
and would damage the country. He was thinking
only of the mediæval emperors, the Roman expeditions,
and Charles <abbr title="5">V.</abbr> For that reason he wished to have only
a King of Germany or of the Germans, while the other
three kings were to resume the title of Dukes&mdash;Duke of
Bavaria, of Suabia and of Saxony. And to this he added
the idea of coercion&mdash;they should be invited to Versailles
and once we had got him there it was to be a case
of needs must when the devil drives (<i lang="de">jetzt friss Vogel
oder stirb</i>). I replied to him that that would be treacherous,
disloyal and ungrateful, and that I would not lend
myself to it, as, moreover, it would have no permanency.
No friendly persuasion could possibly induce the Kings
to submit to this degradation. I then pointed out to
him the advantages of the Emperor idea, somewhat in
the same way as I did afterwards in my letter to the
King of Bavaria. The Kings would prefer to subordinate
themselves to a fellow-countryman, who bore the title
of German Emperor and to grant him certain rights in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span>
war and peace, than to a King of Prussia, who would only
be a somewhat more powerful neighbour. Among the
people, however, the Emperors had left a deeper impression
than had the few princes, who, after the time of
Charlemagne, called themselves, like Henry the Fowler,
German Kings. In the restoration of the Empire they
looked forward to the Emperor as the keystone of the arch.
The Emperor still sits enthroned in Kyffhäuser in North
Germany, and in the South German Untersberge. This
idea should not be connected with that of a Roman
Emperor, Roman expeditions or any pretensions to
universal sovereignty would be against the true
interests of the nation. It was, on the contrary,
a purely national idea which the Emperor would
represent and which we also had in view, the
idea of unification after discord and decay, of
new power and security through unity, of the
concentration of the whole people upon the same objects.
As far back as 1818 such ideas were held by the students’
associations, and in 1848 they found expression in
the <i lang="de">Paulskirche</i>. In 1863 Austria had something
similar in view with her draft constitution to be laid
before the Congress of Princes, only her first thought
was for her own interests.” “Later, on the foundation
of the North German Confederation there was some
talk of an Emperor of the Confederation, and the idea
was only dropped because it would have led to a division
and because in such circumstances Bavaria and
Würtemberg would certainly not have joined us then,
nor probably later on. For similar reasons I declined
Lasker’s suggestion, in February, 1870, to admit Baden
into the Confederation, because that would have been
an attempt to exercise pressure upon her South German
neighbours. The excessive number of Kings gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span>
convinced him, and he was then in favour of the
Emperor idea. In the diary he has forgotten this whole
first act. He writes as if he had discovered the
idea and had been the first to put it forward, while it
had long been kept alive, as a hope among the people,
and he himself at first would not hear of it. Then
came the second act, when it is true we acted together
at the Prefecture in order to win over the old Master
to our view. He at first vehemently rejected our
proposal, and fell into a rage when we insisted. I
asked if he wished to remain a neuter for ever. ‘What
do you mean?’ he said crossly, ‘what sort of a neuter?’
‘Why, the Presidency’ (<i lang="de">Nun das Präsidium</i>), I replied.
But that also was of no avail. Then he agreed to it
up to a certain point, if he were allowed to bear the
title of Emperor of Germany. I explained to him
that this would be opposed to the treaties, and would
express territorial sovereignty over all Germany. He
said the Tsar called himself Emperor of Russia. I
denied this, and stated that his title was Russian
Emperor. (He quoted the Russian term.) He maintained
his opinion, however, until he asked Schneider,
who was obliged to acknowledge that I was right.”
On one occasion he mentioned in a report that Schleinitz
had been present at these negotiations. I now asked:
“What was he doing there? In what capacity was he
present, as Minister of the Household, or as former chief
of the Foreign Office, or in what other capacity?” He
smiled and said: “As confidant of the Queen, who had
sent him to oppose the bombardment and to persuade
the King against it. He had nothing to do with the
Emperor question. He had always been Augusta’s
favourite, and while he was still a poor man she had on
several occasions sent him money, 300 thalers, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span>
to enable him to visit her at Coblenz. It was solely
through her favour that he became Minister.”</p>

<p>We then spoke of Sybel’s “Die deutsche Nation
und das Kaiserreich” (The German Nation and the
Empire), which he gave me; of Morier’s rude letter to
Count Herbert, which was quite uncalled for, as there
had been no charge made against that gentleman of
having given direct information to Bazaine respecting
the movements of the German troops; then of the
wretched attitude of the German Liberal press, which
in this&mdash;as in the Mackenzie, Geffcken, and other
questions&mdash;took the side of every enemy of Germany and
of German interests, whose hand was against him too;
and finally about Samoa, in which connection the Chief
censured the arbitrary conduct of the German Consul
there. The conversation had lasted for about half an
hour, and the Chancellor said as I was leaving that he
would now try to get a little sleep. The article desired
by him was written in the course of the following week,
and was to appear in No. 8 of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> under
the title “The Emperor Question and Geffcken’s Diary
Extracts.” I, however, first submitted a proof to the
Chancellor for revision, and he made a number of
alterations which Rottenburg dictated to me in his
bureau in order that I might reproduce them in my
copy. Thereupon I despatched the latter to Grunow
(Saturday, February 16th), but a few hours later
Rottenburg, with whom I had dined at Professor
Scheibler’s, came back there with a message from the
Chief requesting me to telegraph that the article should
be returned for the present. Even after it had been
toned down it was too dangerous for publication.</p>

<p>At noon on Sunday, the 17th of February, a
Chancery attendant brought me a note from Rottenburg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span>
(begging me to call upon him at 3 o’clock at the
Imperial Chancellerie. He had important instructions
to give me).</p>

<p>On my going to see him at 3 o’clock he told me
that the Chief now wished to have the article printed,
but with a further slight change. We therefore telegraphed
to Grunow to forward me that evening the
proofs I had sent him, which I would return to him
immediately. They arrived at 10 o’clock, when I at
once took them to Rottenburg. We then inserted the
last alterations of the Chief, and sent back the proofs
to Grunow in a registered letter so that the article
should appear in No. 8. <i lang="la" title="Through many perilous adventures">Per tot discrimina rerum.</i></p>

</div>


<p>In February, 1890, a few days after the promulgation
of the Imperial Rescript on the labour question,
Bucher had already pointed out to me in conversation
the difficulties in the way of an international settlement
of the question, and said he imagined the Emperor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span>
going further in this matter than the Chancellor could
approve of.</p>

<p>Monday, February 24th, he said to me: “I have a
commission for you which I must carry out before the
Chancellor of State arrives. The ‘dragon’ sent for
me to-day and asked if I still had any connection with
English newspapers, as he wished to get them to insert
an article on the elections. I was sorry that I had no
longer any such connection, but I thought perhaps you
might write to the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> and get it to
publish the desired article. He said: ‘Busch! Why,
how is he getting on? I understand he has had an
apoplectic attack.’ I replied: ‘Oh! no, he only caught
a bad cold last Whitsuntide, and suffered in particular
from great hoarseness, but he is quite well again now.’
You will observe that the apoplectic attack comes from
friend Holstein.” (Probably reached the Chief’s ears in
quite a harmless way from Scheibler through Rottenburg.)
I replied: “As a matter of fact I have not
written for that paper for years, but they still send it
to me daily, and Kingston, one of their editorial staff
and a leader writer, has translated my book <cite lang="de">Unser
Reichskanzler</cite> into English. I fancy, therefore, they
would take an article from me on the subject suggested
by the Prince.” He then drew an envelope from his
pocket and said: “I have here jotted down our conversation
on the subject. They are for the main part
his own words, pointing out the chief cause of the way
in which the elections turned out, the result of which he
attributes chiefly to the Rescript. Work them up into
an article and see that you get it published in London.
He attaches great importance to it and would like to
see a copy when it appears.” I promised to write and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span>
send off the article next morning, and if it were accepted,
to hand in a copy of it personally to the Chief, when I
should ask him whether I could be of any further use in
the matter. He then mentioned to me that the Prince
was not at all satisfied with the Rescript, nor was he
pleased in other respects with the intentions of the
young Majesty, who had become very self-confident
and arbitrary, and that he had only remained in office
up to the present because he had hoped that the
Emperor would appoint Herbert to be his successor.
He knew already, however, that this desire would not be
fulfilled, as the Emperor objects to Herbert on personal
grounds. (...)</p>

<p>“By the way, when you next visit the Chief, you
should speak in a loud clear voice, as his hearing is not
so good as it was. You should also avoid contradicting
him in any way, as, according to Rottenburg, he is now
very short-tempered and irritable.” Bucher’s notes (the
original of which I have retained) ran as follows:
“Explain the influence of the Imperial Rescript on the
elections. The old Social Democrats (Republicans) acted
as if the Rescript were a victory for their efforts.
Many malcontents&mdash;and who in this world is contented?&mdash;who
were hitherto deterred from joining the
Social Democracy by their monarchical sentiments (and
at bottom the bulk of our people are monarchical), now
believe that they can vote for them with an easy
conscience. The Emperor has offended the bourgeoisie,
and has actually embittered the large manufacturers who
regard the Rescript as an incitement to their workmen.
The lower middle classes, middlemen and shopkeepers,
do not see that their own interests are directly
threatened, as they know how to shift from their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span>
shoulders any increase in the price of goods, but they see
their political position threatened by the fourth estate.
Many of them have therefore fallen away from the <i lang="fr">cartel</i>
candidates who were in favour of the Government, and
for whom they had formerly voted, and took up with
the Progressists, whose leaders are double faced. The
experience obtained during the period of conflict showed
the importance of the sentiments entertained by the
bourgeoisie. At that time they wished to seize the reins
of power, <i lang="fr" title="in the style of">à la</i> Louis Philippe. The masses did not
care, or did not see, yet repeated elections always
yielded the same results. The Emperor does not understand
that, he has had no experience of it; and it is
difficult to make him recognise it as he is surrounded
by too many servile flatterers (<i lang="de">Byzantinern</i>) who confirm
his self-confidence. Among the ‘Sunday’ polling
cards in the eastern provinces there were a great number
with the name of the Emperor William. Conclusion:
Had it not been for the Rescript the elections would
have turned out much as they did three years ago.” I
worked this up into an article for the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>,
and forwarded it to the office in Fleet Street on the
26th of February.</p>

<p>It was not accepted, however, probably because they
considered themselves to be better informed by their
regular correspondent, or did not think themselves
justified in taking sides against the Emperor.</p>

<p>On reaching home on the evening of the 15th of
March I found waiting for me an invitation to do
Prince Bismarck the honour of visiting him on the
following morning at 11.30. (Original retained.) I
went to the palace, No. 77 Wilhelmstrasse, at the
time appointed, and was speedily shown in. The Chief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span>
who was in undress uniform, was sitting in the front
study. He shook hands with me: “Good morning,
Büschlein,” and added with a smile, “you still keep
your fine beard.” Proceeding to the large back room
he called me in to him. There were several boxes and
also a big trunk with papers, while a large cupboard
containing documents was half emptied. He drew
out one drawer of the writing-table and took out a
dark green portfolio in which the correspondence with
Andrassy had been kept at Friedrichsruh, as also the
envelopes containing the papers which I had sorted for
him, and said: “I wish you would look through
these for me, first glance through those from
Friedrichsruh once more, and then those from Varzin
and other new ones; there is still a great number of
them. I said to you at the time that we would resume
the business. Do you still care to do so?”</p>

<p>I: “Most certainly, Serene Highness; I am only too
happy to have the opportunity. I thought several times
of reminding you, but I did not like to appear importunate
and so preferred to wait for your invitation.”</p>

<p>He: “Well, there are others (pointing to the
trunk) and here in the green portfolio are more recent
ones. You should look through these from Friedrichsruh
once more and make a note of those that are of importance
from an historical standpoint, then number all
the rest in chronological order and add a list of the
important ones. I now want to write my memoirs,
and you can help me with them. That means I am
going to retire. You see I am already packing. My
papers are going to be sent off immediately, for if they
remain here much longer, it will end in his seizing
them.” I expressed my amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span></p>

<p>He: “Yes, I cannot remain here any longer and
the sooner I go the better.”</p>

<p>I: “But surely not immediately, Serene Highness?”</p>

<p>He: “It is a question of three days, perhaps of
three weeks, but I am going for certain. I cannot
stand him any longer. He wants even to know whom
I see, and has spies set to watch those who come in
and go out. For that reason, too, I do not well see
how I am to get the papers away. They might be
sent to you, but how?” I replied: “<a id="TN9"></a>I could take
the more important ones away with me, a few small
packets at a time, carrying them in the first place to
Hehn’s and then perhaps to Leipzig.”</p>

<p>He: “Hehn? Who is he?”</p>

<p>I told him, and that he was perfectly trustworthy.</p>

<p>He: “I could also have sent them to Schönhausen,
and you could go there from Friedrichsruh to fetch
them. I want you to have the most important of them
copied and to keep the copies for the present.”</p>

<p>I: “But if a stranger were to copy them he might
betray the contents to others.”</p>

<p>He: “Ah, I am not afraid of that. Of course he
might, but I have no secrets among them&mdash;none whatever.
Come to Friedrichsruh when I am there and we
will work together. But I should like you first to get
a letter from Frederick William <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> into the press. I
saw it at the end of a new book, of which I do not
remember the title, but it was a fabricated version,
inaccurate in form and full of impossibilities and
absurdities. I have a correct copy of the original, but
I cannot find it in your envelopes. (Searched in that
for 1852.) Ah, yes, here it is. Take it with you, copy
it, and then return me the original.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span></p>

<p>I suggested that it should be printed in the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>.</p>

<p>He: “All right, but it must be given as coming
from Vienna, and the publication of the false version
must serve as a reason for publishing it.”</p>

<p>While I was helping him to pack the papers in one
of the boxes he came to speak about the Rescript, and
said: “It comes of an over-estimate of himself, and of
his inexperience of affairs, and that can lead to no good.
He is much too conceited, however, to believe me that
it will merely cause confusion and do harm.”</p>

<p>I: “It is the disgusting &mdash;&mdash; of the press and of
the Court menials that are to blame for his self-deception.”
He laughed. I told him that the article
on the influence exercised by the Rescript on the
elections had been written and sent off, but was not
published by the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>.</p>

<p>He: “It was quite correct, however, as reports
reached us from all sides as to the bad effect which the
Rescript produced on the electors.” He then asked
how old I was.</p>

<p>I: “Sixty-nine, but my father was eighty-six and
my mother eighty-four.”</p>

<p>He: “Well, I should not mind living till I am
eighty, out in the country.” He promised when I left
to send me the latest papers (those in the green portfolio)
to look through, arrange in chronological order,
and copy. I thanked him for his great confidence
in me, which was justified, for as I had already said to
him on one occasion in 1870, he was my Master, and my
Messiah.</p>

<p>He: “Blasphemy! But you have deserved my
confidence.”</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 17th of March a Chancery attendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span>
arrived in a cab with a message that the Prince
requested me to come to him immediately. On my
entering the antechamber, Bleichröder was with him,
and afterwards Herbert, and so I had to wait. At length
Rottenburg, who had already declared that he, too, would
retire, told me that they had gone upstairs to lunch, but
that he would immediately again announce my arrival to
the Prince. He returned in a few minutes with an invitation
from the Chief to take lunch with him. At table
upstairs I met a nephew or cousin of the Prince, to whom
I was introduced as “Büschlein,” and who remembered
having seen me at dinner in Versailles&mdash;doubtless the
then lieutenant of dragoons with the red collar. The
Princess and Count Herbert came in later. The conversation
first turned on a foreign diplomatist, who would
have married Countess Marie if her father had not been
warned against him as a spendthrift. “Besides, I am
altogether against marriages with foreigners,” said the
Chief, “and particularly in the case of diplomatists.”
He then spoke of the alleged second visit of Windthorst.
It had displeased the Emperor, but it was merely a newspaper
invention and ought to be contradicted. “Such
intercourse, however, is useful,” he said. “It is well that
I should in that way keep in touch with the parties, and
for that reason I have always been accessible to them.
Every member of Parliament could come to me at any
time, day or night, and be received immediately. But
they have taken little advantage of this. They do not
want to be considered by their party as having Government
sympathies, and prefer to be able to abuse me for
having no relations with them. It is only the Ultramontanes
who come sometimes, such as Windthorst,
Schorlemer and Hüne, also Frankenstein, who is now
dead. The <i lang="fr">cartel</i> parties hardly ever put in an appearance.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span>
He recommended me to try the caviar. “It has
been sent to me by the Minister of the Imperial Household
at St. Petersburg, and I take it that it is the same
as that which is served to the Emperor Alexander. It is
the best I have ever had.” He also praised the Moselle and
Yquem. On Herbert coming in he laid before the Chief
a portfolio connected with the negotiations in progress
respecting a partition of East Africa, and the latter gave
his opinion as to the frontiers. I accompanied him
downstairs, and he handed me out of the green portfolio
on the table in the large room nine or ten copies in his
own handwriting of letters addressed by him to the Emperor
William <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, during the years 1872 to 1887. “Copy
these and keep the copies by you, and bring me back the
originals, as well as that of the letter of introduction of
1852.”</p>

<p>He also gave me a large envelope containing more
recent letters and reports to be arranged in chronological
order, with dockets on the more important ones for
the purpose of the memoirs. “Return me these to-morrow
or the day after,” he said; and I promised to
bring them back on Thursday. We then went into the
other study, and I said that even now I could not bring
myself to realise that he was retiring; it seemed to me
utterly impossible. He: “Impossible? It is now a
fact. Things have gone more rapidly than I imagined
they would. I thought he would be thankful if I were
to remain with him for a few years, but I find that, on
the contrary, he is simply longing with his whole heart
to be rid of me in order that he may govern alone&mdash;with
his own genius&mdash;and be able to cover himself with
glory. He does not want the old mentor any longer,
but only docile tools. But I cannot make genuflexions
(Ich aber kann nicht mit Proskynesis dienen), nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span>
crouch under the table like a dog. He wants to break
with Russia, and yet he has not the courage to demand
the increase of the army from the Liberals in the
Reichstag. I have succeeded in winning their confidence
at St. Petersburg, and obtain proofs of it every
day. Their Emperor is guided by my wishes in what
he does and in what he refrains from doing. What
will they think there now? And also other expectations
which I cannot fulfil, together with the intrigues
of Courtiers, rudeness and spying, watching with whom
I hold intercourse! My retirement is certain. I
cannot tack on as a tail to my career the failures of
arbitrary and inexperienced self-conceit for which I
should be responsible.”</p>

<p>I: “When he falls into distress and difficulty he
will himself come and fetch you back, Serene Highness!
He will have to beg and implore you.”</p>

<p>He: “No, he is too proud for that. But he would
like to keep Herbert, only that would not do&mdash;that
would be a sort of mixed goods train, and I should
always have to bear part of the responsibility. Moreover,
although Herbert would doubtless stand being
lectured and censured by me, he would not stand it
from Imperial Chancellor Bötticher.” (He therefore
seemed to think that the latter had been selected as his
successor, and knew nothing as yet of the choice of
Caprivi). “Besides they have treated his father badly.”
I said: “The Emperor William seems to have the
same notion as King Frederick William <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> had, according
to Sybel, namely, that Kings in virtue of their
office know everything better than their best servants.”
He: “Yes, obedient Ministers! He has altogether a
great deal in common with him.”... I proposed to
publish the letters of William <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, or at least a few of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span>
them, and mentioned the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> as a paper from
which they would be largely quoted. He seemed to
like the idea. “I will see about it when you bring me
back the originals. If you do not then see me, report
yourself at Friedrichsruh in a short time. I shall now
go out riding for a while.” As I was leaving the
room, he clapped me on the shoulder in a friendly
way. In the antechamber, Rottenburg again said
he would also retire. His nerves could no longer
stand it. Very nice of him, but we shall see how the
cat jumps.</p>

<p>On Thursday, March 20th, I took back to the Chief
the originals of his letters to William <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> He looked
through them and sanctioned the publication in the
<cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> of the first three, adding at the same time:
“We shall first publish these which refer to family
matters, and see what impression they make. Then we
can let the others follow, and perhaps later on still more
from the collection.”</p>

<p>I: “Perhaps articles also?”</p>

<p>He (smiling): “Yes, perhaps. Hamburg newspapers
would also accept something of the kind. I have recommended
the <cite lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine</cite>, which the
company that owns it placed at my disposal, to the
Conservatives (doubtless those belonging to the Free
Conservative wing) as their organ.”</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 22nd, I returned to him in an
envelope the thirty-nine new papers chronologically
arranged and numbered, the most important ones being
specially docketed. The latter were: No. 14, letter
written by William <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> in 1884; on the Battenberger and
his projected marriage, 16, 18, 21, 31, and 33; a letter
to the Chief from the Crown Prince Frederick at Portofino,
describing his eldest son as inexperienced, extremely
boastful and self-conceited; a letter from Crown Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span>
William to Bismarck in 1888 on the “Battenberger”
business and Albedyll’s plan for “nailing down” Prince
Alexander by a written declaration; a letter of the
Battenberger from Sofia to the Queen of England, sent
to the Chancellor with a letter from the Crown Princess
Victoria (two copies); a report by Professor von Bergmann
on the illness of the Emperor Frederick; a letter
from the Grand Duke of Baden respecting an interview
with the sick monarch, which had taken place according
to arrangement with him alone (without the Englishwoman)
when the Emperor listened with deep seriousness
to the statement made to him by the Grand Duke:
“You cannot govern without Prince Bismarck (Ohne
Fürst Bismarck kannst Du nicht regieren).” The
Chief looked through the particulars of the contents
which I had written on the envelope, and observed:
“Those are really important papers, but take them back
with you and keep them at your house for the present.”
He then reflected, however, and said: “I am being
watched, and you also, and if you are seen coming and
going with a large envelope&mdash;this will be better. Come
here!” He then went into the back study to a large
trunk standing in the middle of the room. I followed
him, and he raised the cover of a green portfolio which
was packed up in it under a round box. “Those are
maps,” he said. “Lay these papers between them, and
remember where they are in case I should forget it,
when we proceed with the Memoirs at Friedrichsruh. I
am sending about 300 cases and other things away, and
13,000 bottles of wine. That is a great deal, but it
includes many presents. Besides, while I still had
money I bought several lots of good sherry, which will
come in for my children. Write to me a fortnight after
I reach Friedrichsruh and ask when you can come on a
long visit and help me with the Memoirs. I must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span>
a private secretary so that I may be able to dictate and
dispose of minor affairs by letter. That is not for you,
however, as I intend to employ you on something
better. I have accordingly asked Schweninger to find
a young doctor for this purpose, who would also be at
hand in case of indisposition and accident, as, for
instance, if I were to hurt myself out riding. It would be
something for him, too, as it would in any case bring him
in a couple of thousand marks. Keep yourself free for
our business.” I replied that I would arrange for the
present to remain with him for six months, and if
necessary for a further period later on, after a short holiday.
We then returned to the front room and sat down,
when he said: “There is one thing I would ask you
to do now if you still have any influence in the press,
that is, to correct a mistake which I have repeatedly
noticed in newspaper articles within the last few days,
as also in communications from exalted places, as, for
instance, from England&mdash;with suppositions and reproaches&mdash;namely,
that I had sent in my resignation
owing to my apprehension of great crises, and left the
Emperor in the lurch through fear of the increased
Opposition in the new Reichstag. A glance at my past
history and character ought to have discredited that
notion, and a remembrance of the conflict of 1866,
when the Opposition was much stronger, and more
dangerous, and of my loyalty to my royal master, which
I likewise showed and proved on later occasions. But,
as a matter of fact, it is quite wrong. On the contrary,
I did not want to retire until the summer, and, in the
meantime, offered to defend the Imperial policy in the
Reichstag, and to take up the struggle with the Opposition.
I was not permitted to do so however.... He
wants to do everything himself, and he fancies that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span>
can.” He then spoke once more of spying, and of the
Emperor setting a watch upon him to see with whom
he held intercourse. (Probably Windthorst’s visit.)
“That is one of the final reasons that have induced me
to tender my resignation.” He stood up, bent across
the table, resting on his two hands, and smiling as he
looked me straight in the face, said: “But, tell me, do
you drink much wine?” I replied: “During the daytime
no spirituous liquors whatever, not even at table.
In the evening two pints of thin, sour Moselle.” “So!”
he rejoined. “You certainly gave me the impression
of having stowed away a bottle of Burgundy, and yet
a short time ago you had some little trouble. (Apoplectic
attack?) Otherwise I do not in the least
disapprove of it, as I myself drink my share. But
take care of yourself, for I wish to keep you with us for
a long time yet.” It was then arranged once more that
I should write to him a fortnight after his arrival at
Friedrichsruh, but in the first only to arrange for a
shorter visit, during which we should talk over and settle
about a longer stay later on.</p>

<p>On Monday, March 24th, the Chief again sent, by a
Chancery attendant, to fetch me in a cab. I had to
wait in the antechamber from 11.45 to 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> as
Caprivi was taking lunch upstairs with the Prince. I
then saw the new Imperial Chancellor, as he was going
away. Scheibler congratulated Rottenburg on a second
quality Red Eagle and oakleaf, which may possibly
soothe his nerves. On being called in I found the Chief
seated in a <i lang="fr" title="sofa for two">causeuse</i> before his writing-table. I handed
him to-day’s <cite lang="de">Post</cite>, which Rottenburg had given me for
him. He read out to me the short leader of the 23rd
(which I have kept), and said: “They, too, want to
curry favour. That comes from gentlemen at Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span>
who want to hush up things. Please say something
against that! Could the Liberals themselves abuse me
worse? Not the worst, but, on the contrary, the best
service that could be done to me would be to give a
correct answer to the question whether my retirement
has been voluntary or involuntary; and that answer
is: involuntary. It is a patriotic duty not to maintain
the utmost reserve, but, on the contrary, to tell the
truth. The young man would, however, like to have it
hushed up. Indeed, he has gone so far as to summon
Schweninger, and to try to make him believe that it
was due to considerations of health. Yes, there is a
great deal of flunkeyism (<i lang="de">Byzantinerthum</i>) here, and
they all crawl on their bellies before him, in order to
attract one gracious look upon themselves.” I asked
if he would stay on much longer. He said: “No,
to-morrow or the next day.”</p>

<p>I: “Then I am to write to your Serene Highness
in fourteen or fifteen days about my visit?”</p>

<p>He: “You can write even earlier, and come very
soon.”</p>

<p>The desired article was despatched to the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>
as an appendix to that recently ordered. It appeared
in No. 14, immediately following a longer article
(probably by Kayser) which preached from the same
text as the <cite>Post</cite>. The first three letters from Bismarck
to William <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> appeared at the head of No. 14. They ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has given my wife and myself great
pleasure by sharing in our family festival, and we beg
your Majesty graciously to accept our respectful thanks.
Your Majesty is right in giving the first place among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span>
the blessings for which I have to thank God to my
domestic happiness, but happily in my house that
happiness both for my wife and for myself includes the
consciousness of your Majesty’s satisfaction; and the
extremely gracious and friendly words of recognition
contained in your Majesty’s letter do more to soothe
disordered nerves than all the art of the physician. In
looking back upon my life I have had such inexhaustible
reasons to thank God for His unmerited mercies that I
often fear I cannot remain so fortunate to the end. I
regard it as a particularly happy dispensation of
Providence that my vocation on earth should be the
service of a master for whom I can work with pleasure
and affection, as&mdash;under your Majesty’s guidance&mdash;the
inborn loyalty of the subject need never fear to find
itself in opposition to a hearty devotion to the honour
and welfare of the Fatherland. May God continue
to grant me strength, as well as will, to serve
your Majesty in such a manner that I may preserve
your Majesty’s satisfaction with my efforts, of which
such a gracious evidence now lies before me in the shape
of the letter of the 26th. The vase, which arrived in
good time, is a truly monumental expression of royal
favour, and is at the same time so substantial that I may
hope that not the ‘fragments’ only, but the whole, will
go down to my descendants as a proof of your Majesty’s
gracious participation in our silver wedding.</p>

<p>“The officers of the 54th Regiment, in a spirit of
comradeship and friendliness, sent their band from
Kolberg. Otherwise, as usually happens in the country,
we were restricted to the more intimate family circle,
with the exception that Motley, the former American
Minister in London, a friend of my youth, chanced to
be here on a visit. In addition to her Majesty the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span>
Empress, his Majesty the King of Bavaria and their
Royal Highnesses Prince Charles and Frederick Charles,
and <abbr title="His Imperial Highness">H.I.H.</abbr> the Crown Prince have honoured me with
telegraphic congratulations.</p>

<p>“My health is slowly improving. It is true I
have done no work whatever, yet I hope to be able to
report myself to your Majesty as fit for service in time
for the Imperial visit.</p>

<p class="extra">“I am greatly depressed at being unable, on
receipt of your Majesty’s gracious communication of the
9th instant, to proceed to Berlin at once and place myself
at your Majesty’s disposal in the present crisis, all
the more so as towards the end of last month I believed
I should soon be sufficiently restored to do so. Since
my return from Berlin I found my strength constantly
increasing, and for that reason and also through my
interest in the matter, I allowed myself to be tempted,
in opposition to the urgent warnings of the doctor, to
yield to Count Eulenburg’s frequent appeals, and
endeavour to influence the course of affairs by communications
to your Majesty, and correspondence with the
Ministers and with Members of the Upper House. That
is certainly very hazardous to proceed in such a fashion,
and at such a distance, in the absence of discussions
which might throw light upon the questions at issue,
without knowledge of the opposing views, and also
without sufficient assistance. I had hoped, however,
that it would only last a few days and that things
would soon again enter upon a more peaceful course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span>
Unfortunately, this attempt only too speedily convinced
me that my doctor was right, and that my store of
newly-recovered strength was very slight. I am greatly
discouraged, as my intervention will have exercised
rather a disturbing influence than otherwise, while the
few days’ work and excitement, with the nervous irritability
which it involves, have sufficed once more to prove
to me clearly the lassitude of my intellectual powers. I
fear I am more exhausted than I should like to confess
to myself. This anxiety, as well as the feeling of shame
that I am unable to be at my post and at your Majesty’s
service at such an important moment, is a source of
great depression, even when I say to myself that I must
humbly submit to the will of God, who does not require
my co-operation and puts limits to my strength. My
uneasiness is counterbalanced by the confidence which
your Majesty expresses at the close of your letter, and
which I fully share, that the grace of God which has
hitherto blessed your Majesty’s Government will continue
to assist it. The course which your Majesty has
sanctioned in Council can lead to the same ends just as
well as that proposed by me, provided there is no breach
with the present Parliament and my colleagues remain
united among themselves. They will do that for your
Majesty’s sake, although up to the present there have
been many indications of differences. I fear that my
correspondence with some of them individually, in reply
to questions addressed to me, may have sometimes
increased the elements of discord, and that misunderstandings
may have arisen with respect to myself owing
to the fact that the contents of my reports were fully
known only to those to whom they were addressed. I
have therefore requested Roon only to consult me at
your Majesty’s express command, and I have informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span>
him that I shall no longer correspond with my colleagues
individually.</p>

<p>“In this manner my co-operation, so long as God
does not give me better strength, will rest in your
Majesty’s gracious and considerate hands. My hope
and my prayer to God is that it may be soon granted to
me once more to do my duty in person under your
Majesty’s eyes, and to again find that peace which lies
in work.</p>

<p>“I thank your Majesty respectfully and heartily for
the beautiful Christmas present, conferring fresh distinction
upon me.</p>

<p>“My father entered the regiment of Carabineers of
the Life Guard in 1783, and also had the honour, at the
review, of being presented to Frederick the Great as a
Junker, on which occasion the great king condescended
in gracious recognition to hold up to him as a model his
grandfather, Major von Bismarck (of the Schulenberg,
afterwards Bayreuth, Dragoons), who fell at Czaslau.</p>

<p>“This and many other impressive reminiscences,
which my father handed down to me from the time of
Frederick the Great, as reproduced in the work of art
now standing before me, and which I can supplement
with a well-preserved series of letters from my grandfather
in the field during the Seven Years’ War, form
the permanent impressions of my childhood. I have
always regretted that, by the will of my parents, I was
not allowed to prove my devotion to the Royal House
and my enthusiasm for the greatness and renown of the
Fatherland in the fighting ranks of the army, rather
than behind the writing desk. Even to-day, after your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span>
Majesty has raised me to the highest honours as a
statesman, I cannot entirely suppress my regret at not
having been able to win similar advancement as a
soldier. I beg your Majesty, as it is Christmas Eve, to
forgive this expression of personal feelings in a man who
is accustomed on Christian festivals to look back upon
his past. I might have been, perhaps, a worthless
general, but I should have preferred to win battles for
your Majesty, like those generals who adorn the
monument, rather than diplomatic campaigns. By the
will of God, and your Majesty’s favour, I have a
prospect of seeing my name recorded in books and in
bronze when posterity immortalises the memory of your
Majesty’s glorious reign. But, independently of the
loyalty of every honourable nobleman to his sovereign,
the cordial attachment which I entertain for your
Majesty’s person, and the pain and anxiety which I feel
at not being always able to serve your Majesty as I wish,
and no longer with my whole strength, can find expression
in no monument. Yet in the last resort it is
only this personal feeling which makes the servant follow
his monarch and the soldier his leader with uncalculating
devotion on such paths as under Divine Providence
Frederick <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> and your Majesty have entered upon.
My strength for work is no longer equal to my will, but
up to my last breath the latter shall be devoted to your
Majesty.</p>

<p>“I have received with respectful thanks your Majesty’s
gracious letter of the 8th instant, and am pleased
above all things to see that the cure has agreed
with your Majesty in spite of the run of bad weather
in the Alps. With respect to the letter from Queen
Victoria I have the honour to add again that it would
have been very interesting if her Majesty had expressed
herself more fully as to the origin of the rumours of war
circulated at that time. The sources must have been
regarded as very trustworthy by that exalted lady, as
otherwise her Majesty would not have again referred to
them, and the English Government would also not
have taken in connection with them measures of such an
important character and such an unfriendly nature
towards us. I do not know whether your Majesty
considers it possible to take Queen Victoria at her word
when her Majesty asserts that ‘it is an easy matter for
her to prove that her apprehensions were not exaggerated.’
It would also be doubtless of importance to
ascertain from what quarter such ‘serious errors’ could
have been despatched to Windsor. The hints as to
persons who must be regarded as ‘representatives’ of
your Majesty’s Government would appear to refer to
Count Münster. He, like Count Moltke, may very well
have spoken academically of the usefulness of a timely
attack upon France, although I do not know that he has,
and he was never instructed to do so. It may indeed be
said that it is not calculated to promote the maintenance of
peace for France to have the assurance that she will never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span>
be attacked under <em>any</em> circumstances, do what she may.
Now, as in 1867 in the Luxemburg question, I would
never advise your Majesty to begin hostilities at once,
merely because it was probable that the enemy would
shortly enter upon them. One can never foresee the
ways of Providence with sufficient clearness to do that.
But it is also of no use to give the opponent the
<em>assurance</em> that one will wait for his attack <em>under all circumstances</em>.
I should therefore not blame Münster if he
had spoken in that sense occasionally, and the English
Government would have no right to take official steps
upon non-official remarks of our Ambassador, and, <i lang="fr" title="without informing you">sans
vous dire gare</i>, to invite the other Powers to bring
pressure to bear. Such a serious and unfriendly course
of action gives reason to suspect that Queen Victoria
had yet other grounds for believing in warlike intentions
than incidental remarks by Count Münster, the
authenticity of which I do not even credit. Lord (Odo)
Russell declares he has always reported his firm belief
in our peaceful intentions. On the other hand, all the
Ultramontanes and their friends have charged us
secretly, and openly in the press, with wishing to bring
on war in a short time, and the French Ambassador,
who moves in these circles, sent these lies to Paris as
trustworthy information. But at bottom that too would
not be sufficient to inspire Queen Victoria with such
trust and confidence in falsehoods that had been denied
by <em>your Majesty</em> in person, as she still expresses in her
letter of the 20th of June. I am too little acquainted
with the idiosyncrasies of the Queen to be able to form
an opinion as to whether the phrase about its being
‘easy to prove’ may possibly be intended merely to
conceal, instead of openly confessing, a hastiness of
action which could no longer be recalled. I beg your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span>
Majesty to excuse me if my ‘professional’ interest has
led me, after three months’ forbearance, to dwell at such
length upon an incident which has already been settled.</p>

<p>“The Turkish question can hardly assume large
proportions if the three Imperial Courts remain united;
and that end can be promoted most successfully by
your Majesty, because we are the only Power that has
now, and for a long time to come will have, no direct
interests at stake. Moreover, it can only be of advantage
to us if public attention and the policy of
other Powers should, for a while, be directed elsewhere
than to the Franco-German question.</p>

<p>“As your Majesty has been gracious enough to
mention my health, I beg respectfully to report that
the six weeks’ cure at Kissingen has affected me more
than that of last year. I feel very exhausted, can walk
little, and cannot ride at all as yet. This is now to be
remedied by a course of malt and brine baths, and, as a
matter of fact, the first four have had a good effect. I
therefore hope that the next six weeks will render me
more fit for work, though I fear that I must rely upon
your Majesty’s consideration more largely than my
sense of duty would fain allow. My wife and daughter
thank your Majesty respectfully for your gracious remembrance
of them, and commend themselves to your
Majesty’s favour.</p>

heartfelt wish that, in resuming the reins of Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span>
your Majesty may find, in God’s blessing, consolation
and satisfaction for the crime and ingratitude of
mankind, which must have cut as deeply into your
Majesty’s heart as the wound externally inflicted.</p>

<p>“The sudden transition from the cure at Gastein to
the work in the Reichstag appears to have hindered my
recovery, so that even to-day I am not as well as I was
in September. But if your Majesty will be gracious
enough to allow me four to six weeks’ further leave of
absence and forest air, I may hope, with the help of
God, that in January I can, with fresh strength, place
myself at your Majesty’s disposal for the preparing the
work in the Reichstag. This year, owing to the necessity
for far-reaching financial and economic reforms,
the proceedings in the Reichstag will be particularly
laborious; and it is to be foreseen that they will be accompanied
by severe struggles between the parties themselves,
and against your Majesty’s Government. I do
not, however, doubt that, in the financial and economic
questions, the result will ultimately be favourable, if
concord can be maintained in the Ministry of State and
with the more important Federal Governments, and if
the Ministry preserves that firmness and decision which
your Majesty’s leadership has secured to us in all
difficult situations, and to which, next to God, we owe
all our great success.</p>

wishes for the new year at your Majesty’s feet. At the
present moment I myself am physically stronger than I
have been for many years, and yesterday was able to
take a ride of several hours in the woods with my two
sons, who are staying here on a holiday. Although I
may not as yet strain my nerves in intellectual work to
the extent demanded by my position, I hope for a further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span>
improvement in this direction also if your Majesty will
graciously permit me to remain here until the end of
next month. God grant your Majesty a happy
Christmas, health, and contentment.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has made the anniversary of Sedan
a day of exceptional joy and honour to me by graciously
investing me with the Order <i lang="fr">Pour le Mérite</i>, at the
same time increasing the significance of the distinction
by the exceedingly gracious words which accompanied
it yesterday. I am happy to see from this, and to
realise on looking backwards over a long series of years,
that your Majesty’s favour and confidence have been my
constant and unalterable support, and that your
Majesty’s consideration also compensates for my failing
strength. Your Majesty’s recognition and good will is
in itself the highest satisfaction to which I aspire in
this world, but it is also a pleasure to me when the
world ascertains that I have always been, and still am,
in possession of the boon for which I have ever striven,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the favour of my earthly master. I will always
faithfully and zealously endeavour to deserve it, so that
your Majesty, as the highest and most competent
authority, may recognise in me the heart and sentiments
of a Prussian soldier. I desire no higher praise than
that contained in those words, when they bear your
Majesty’s signature.</p>

<p>“On the 11th I hope to lay my renewed thanks
personally at your Majesty’s feet, and to see your
Majesty in good health.</p>

<p>“I respectfully thank your Majesty for the beautiful
Christmas present. The work of art reminds me to
some extent of my own position. While the centaur
has both hands engaged in lifting the huge horn to his
shoulder, the woman hangs on to his beard with her
whole weight. So it is with me! While I have my
hands full in the service of your Majesty and the
country, the Opposition in Parliament pulls and drags
at me, at the risk of overthrowing me while bearing the
burden of affairs. Moreover, the Opposition is unfortunately
much uglier than the female form that
clings to the centaur’s beard. I will not, however, allow
this to prevent me from gladly and firmly carrying the
burden on my shoulders, so long as God gives me strength
to do so, and I enjoy your Majesty’s favour. With the
heartiest and most respectful wishes for your Majesty’s
Christmas, I unite those for the coming year, reserving
to myself the pleasure of reiterating them verbally.</p>

<p>“I thank your Majesty respectfully for the gracious
letter of the 23rd instant, and for the gracious present
of the picture of the palace, in which I had the honour
for so many years to make my reports to, and to
receive my orders from, your Majesty. For me the day
received a special consecration, through the greeting with
which I was honoured at your Majesty’s bidding, by
their Royal Highnesses Prince William and Prince
Henry. But even without this further evidence of
favour, the feeling with which I greeted the twenty-fifth
anniversary of my appointment as Minister was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span>
of the heartiest and most respectful gratitude towards
your Majesty. Every monarch appoints Ministers, but
there is scarcely an instance in recent times of a monarch
retaining and protecting his Prime Minister, against
every kind of hostility and intrigue, during twenty-five
long years of vicissitudes, when not every measure
succeeds. During this lapse of time, I have seen many
former friends change into opponents, but your Majesty’s
favour and confidence in me has remained immutably
the same. In this thought I find a rich reward for all
my work and consolation in sickness and solitude. I
love my Fatherland, the German as well as the
Prussian, but I could not have served it joyfully if it
had not been granted to me to do so to the satisfaction
of my King. The foundation and the indestructible
core of the high position which I owe to the favour of
your Majesty is the Brandenburg liegeman and the
Prussian officer, and therefore your Majesty’s satisfaction
is a source of happiness to me, without which every
form of popularity would be worthless and distressing.
In addition to numerous telegrams and letters received
by me on the 23rd, from Germany and abroad, I have
had very gracious greetings and congratulations from
their Majesties of Saxony and Würtemberg, <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> the
Regent of Bavaria, the Grand Dukes of Weimar, Baden
and Oldenburg, and other reigning personages, as also
from his Majesty the King of Italy, and Minister Crispi.
The two latter communications touched on politics, and
were difficult to answer. As your Majesty may perhaps
be interested in the text, I have instructed the Foreign
Office to submit them.</p>

<p>“I thank your Majesty respectfully for the gracious
letter of the 23rd, and for the evidence of favour with
which it was accompanied, and first for the drinking
horn with the hunting trophies, which I regard as
intended for your Majesty’s Grand Huntsman of
Pomerania, and shall keep at Varzin. But my chief
happiness arises from the recognition accorded to my
son by his official promotion, which shows me that your
Majesty is satisfied with his work, and therefore that
he fulfils the end for which I have educated him. I
crave your Majesty’s further indulgence towards him,
feeling certain that he will deserve it by his attachment
even in those matters in which he still lacks
experience.</p>

<p>“With reference to my most humble suggestion
respecting the further preparation of <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr> Prince
William for State affairs, I appreciate and share the
anxiety with which your Majesty is inspired by your
solicitude for the health of his Imperial Highness (the
Crown Prince). I considered it my duty to raise the
question, but I do not venture to urge it any further, not
wishing to make myself responsible for the consequences
upon the health of <abbr title="His Imperial Highness">H.I.H.</abbr> which any irritation might
produce. Perhaps the object which it is sought to
attain in the interests of the State may be approached
in a manner less calculated to attract attention; and
this would not be difficult if the Prince resided in Berlin
instead of at Potsdam. I therefore respectfully beg
your Majesty’s permission to submit my views on the
subject when I return to Berlin, which I hope to do
next month. In the meantime, I humbly beg your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span>
Majesty to allow me to try and move <abbr title="His Imperial Highness">H.I.H.</abbr> to
submit to your Majesty, on his own initiative,
the proposed scheme for a Civil Adlatus to be
attached to the Prince. Count Radolinski, who called
upon me to-day, thinks there is some prospect of this
attempt being successful, as the Crown Prince’s irritation
in the matter was connected with the question
whether his parental authority would be taken into
consideration or not. If <abbr title="His Imperial Highness">H.I.H.</abbr> could be moved himself
to propose the object in view, which would be of advantage
to the State, the entire difficulty would be at an
end. Should the attempt fail, no great harm would be
done, as the Crown Prince could easily give <em>me</em> a
negative answer, which he could not give to your
Majesty. Meanwhile, the present system of giving the
Prince occupation at some of the Ministries may be
continued as heretofore, in accordance with your
Majesty’s intention.</p>

<p>“I have ascertained through Count Stolberg
that <abbr title="His Imperial Highness">H.I.H.</abbr> has suggested the promotion of Count
Radolinski to the title of Excellency. I beg respectfully
to recommend this proposal of the Crown
Prince, in the first place because granting it would have
a favourable, and refusing it an unfavourable, effect upon
the sentiments and health of <abbr title="His Imperial Highness">H.I.H.</abbr>; and then furthermore
because Count Radolinski is worthy of such a distinction.
With a large fortune and very considerable
private interests, he has given up an easy position in the
diplomatic service, and, solely in obedience to your
Majesty’s wishes, has willingly undertaken his present
duties, which, often very onerous, are rendered specially
difficult by the rivalries to which they expose him; and
it is desirable that a nobleman of his prestige and
uprightness should continue to discharge them. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span>
he is one of the few Polish noblemen who, like the
deceased Count Raczinski, may be relied upon with
perfect safety by your Majesty and the Prussian State,
and in my opinion this attribute alone deserves to be
recognised by a distinction. Indeed, custom alone would
have secured him such a distinction even if, without being
a Court official, he had lived on his estates in Posen as
a magnate loyal to the Government.</p>

<p>“I beg your Majesty graciously to accept my hearty
and respectful good wishes for the New Year. I hope
to renew them verbally in the course of January, and to
be permitted to report myself to your Majesty, at the
same time as the Reichstag, in as good health as I have
any prospect of enjoying in this life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>... No. 31.&mdash;Letter from Prince William to the
Imperial Chancellor, dated Berlin, April 2nd, 1888:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Albedyll has been to see me and talked over the
whole Battenberg affair (die ganze Battenbergerei) once
more. On this occasion a letter was also mentioned,
which the Empress is understood to have received
yesterday, in which the Battenberger informs her that he
would only marry with my consent&mdash;a point deserving
mention. In this connection Albedyll was of opinion
that a positive acknowledgment, repeating this phrase,
should be demanded from the Battenberger in order to
have a more certain hold over him. Would your Serene
Highness approve of my sending a cipher telegram
ordering Henry to go to him and demand from him for
me a note containing the above declaration? If that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span>
were in my hands, and the Battenberger were nevertheless
to take any steps or to enter into any intrigues, we
could prove by documentary evidence that he had been
guilty of a direct breach of his word.</p>

<p>No. 33.&mdash;The Grand Duke of Baden to the Imperial

<p>“Serene Highness,&mdash;I hasten to let you know in this
inadequate form that I had occasion to-day to speak to the
Emperor Frederick <em>alone</em>. In the manner arranged yesterday
I explained to him how I came to know your
sentiments and state of health. My explanation greatly
impressed the Emperor, and I took advantage of this to
proceed to the general situation of political affairs in
Europe, and&mdash;referring to the firmly established position
of Germany during the reign of the Emperor William,
as compared to the troubles and confusion in the rest of
the world&mdash;emphasised the necessity for us and for
Europe of perseverance in the course adopted.</p>

<p>“The Emperor manifested a friendly disposition,
and warmly approved of my statement. He is
anxiously expecting your visit. His features wore an
expression of deep seriousness when I said to him:
‘You cannot possibly govern without Prince Bismarck.’</p>

endeavours.</p>

<p>A few days after our last interview, the Chief left
for Friedrichsruh. On the 11th of April I wrote him
(respecting my proposed stay there). I received no
answer for a week. The newspapers, however, published
a report that the Prince had selected as his private
secretary a Dr. Chrysander, who had hitherto been
Professor Schweninger’s assistant, and who would help
him in preparing his memoirs. According to a second
press notice, he was also to be assisted by a member of
the editorial staff of the <cite lang="de">Hamburger Nachrichten</cite>.
Bucher ultimately wrote me that he was going to
Friedrichsruh, and hoped we “should be harnessed
together.” (...)</p>

<p>I called upon him the same day to congratulate him,
and mentioned to him my fear that nothing would now
come of my proposed visit to Friedrichsruh. Perhaps
my letter of the 11th had not reached the Chief’s
hands; or perhaps he had been turned against me by
an article on his retirement, published in the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite>,
which was, however, written by Kayser, and reached
Grunow just before mine. Bucher reassured me as to
this supposition, but said that Kayser, like Lindau and
Holstein, had actually gone over into the other camp.
(...) Although he considered it quite impossible
that the Prince could now give up the idea of employing
me in connection with the papers, I did not feel sure of
this, and so a few days afterwards I wrote again to the
Prince, and registered my letter. Count Herbert
replied that “the Prince intends to invite you here in
order to sort some papers. In the meantime, however,
he is too much occupied by visits and the arrangements
rendered necessary by his removal to take these papers
in hand immediately.”</p>

<p>A fortnight later, after I had received a post card<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>
from Bucher informing me that he had started for
Friedrichsruh, I wrote to him there (as to the proposed
visit, and giving him an account of my future movements).
This crossed the following letter, which Bucher
sent to me under cover to Frau Hedwig Hämmerling:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Friedrichsruh</span>, <i>May 15, 1890</i>.
</p>

<p>“I have two reasons for sending you this letter under
cover to another person; first, because you have not informed
me of your whereabouts, and secondly, because
there is some reason to suspect the existence of a Dark
Cabinet. Therefore be prudent when you write to me
here. I have had a large bundle to sort and register,
and in doing so have satisfied myself that you have
exhausted the materials. What came into my hands
was very unimportant,&mdash;congratulations, letters of
thanks, telegrams, reports from aides-de-camp and such
like. (...) I am expected to remain until H. returns
from England, probably towards the end of this month.
He (the Chief) is physically well, and is gradually
quieting down.”</p>
</div>

<p>I immediately acknowledged the receipt of Bucher’s
note, and reminded him of the concluding request in my
former letter. He replied on the 17th of May, 1890,
again under cover to Hedwig Hämmerling: “To enable
me to answer your questions I should be obliged to ask
him, and up to the present I have had no opportunity
of doing so. (...) After your registered letter and
the reply thereto, it seems to me not to be in your
interest that I should also press the matter. Besides, he
talks of presently starting on a lengthy tour to countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
which he has not yet visited&mdash;certainly a very happy
idea. I take it that he will not begin work before his
return in the autumn; and then he will doubtless remember
his arrangement with you. I will write you as
soon as the departure is approximately settled.”</p>

<p>On the 20th of May I had an attack of apoplexy
combined with paralysis, from which it took me six
months to make an almost complete recovery; that is to
say, with the exception that my handwriting had changed
and my voice remained hoarse.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, Frau Hämmerling received a
note from Friedrichsruh (from Bucher, inquiring as to
my illness). On Frau Hämmerling informing him of
the truth he wrote me as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Busch</span>,&mdash;I need not tell you how heartily I
sympathise with you. I now write to put your mind
at rest on one point, to tell you that you have missed
nothing here, and will not miss anything during the
next few weeks. I have had five or six thousand
letters, extending from the fifties to the present day, to
arrange in chronological order. They were all mixed
up anyhow, both as regards dates and matter. They
contain little on politics, and of that little again but a
small portion refers to foreign affairs. He was not prepared
to accept my suggestion that it would be well to
put the begging letters, medical counsels, schemes for
the improvement of the world at large, thundering
hurrahs and fiery ‘salamanders’ into the fire. Therefore,
when the preliminary work begins you will have
to wander through a desert from which I have only
removed tradesmen’s bills, &amp;c. It is as yet impossible
to say when that will be. He complains, with that
humorous self-mocking air of desperation which you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span>
know, that he has now no time to set about anything.
His excuse for the present is that of course the whole
material must first be chronologically arranged, which
will doubtless take a fortnight longer, although I am
keeping hard at it. And then he will certainly be
obliged to make some change in his way of living and in
the apportionment of his time. The projected journeys
will hardly come to anything; but even if he remains
here he will not begin work before you are recovered&mdash;according
to what F. H. (Frau Hämmerling) writes me.
There is no idea of calling in Poschinger. He knows
that the man is incapable of giving shape or form to
anything of the kind.</p>

<p>“He himself and Herbert desire me to express their
sympathy to you. With good wishes for your improvement,</p>

<p class="signoff1">
“Truly yours (in English),</p>

<p class="signature">“<span class="smcap">Bucher</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>In the days immediately preceding and following
this letter, the newspapers published many things from
Friedrichsruh which were anything but pleasant reading
to me, or were at least at variance with my conception
of the greatness and distinguished character of the
Prince, and also to some extent with the opinions which
he had himself formerly expressed. He allowed it to
be seen too often and too plainly, for the benefit of the
Court and to the delight of the Radical Thersites, how
mortified he felt at his base dismissal; he expressed
himself, as I thought, too confidentially, and indeed it
would appear sometimes with conscious untruth, in
speaking to importunate Jew press spies and other eavesdroppers
and talebearers from the newspaper factories.
The most inexplicable of all to me was what he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span>
represented as having said to Kingston, of the <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite>, concerning the excellence of the late Emperor
Frederick&mdash;which was diametrically the opposite of
what he had said to me in Berlin and at Friedrichsruh.
The principal passage in the Englishman’s report runs as
follows: “Finally, the conversation turned on the
Emperor Frederick, of whom Prince Bismarck spoke
with the profoundest admiration. He was in truth a
man of rare and most estimable character, thoroughly
amiable, exceptionally good-hearted, and at the same
time intelligent, clear-sighted and determined. He knew
exactly what he wanted, and when once he had come to
a decision he held to it immutably. If he had only
lived he would, as German Emperor, have amazed the
world.” (Retranslation&mdash;translator’s note.) Really!
That would then be a case of a farthing candle developing
into a first-class lighthouse! Was it Bismarck or
Kingston who said that? If the former he must have
had some particular object in view. But what could it
be? To elevate Frederick <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> at the expense of
William <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>? (...)</p>

<p>I afterwards received from Bucher the following
letter from Berlin:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I must send you another short contribution to
your Memorabilia. When Count Herbert gave a farewell
dinner to the officials, four of them&mdash;Holstein, Lindau,
Kayser and Raschdau&mdash;declined the invitation. All
four owed everything to the Prince. Not a word has
been heard from Keudell since the 20th of March.
Lehndorff, Stirum, Krupp, Stumm and Kardorff have
defied the royal displeasure by visiting Friedrichsruh.
After Bötticher, who owes his promotion to the Prince,
had told the Emperor that Bismarck was a slave to
morphia, his Majesty sent for Schweninger, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span>
questioned him on the subject. Schweninger answered:
‘Your Majesty, that is a wretched calumny, and I know
the curs with whom it originated.’ (...)</p>

<p>“As a contrast to this pretty set! Shortly before
my departure from Friedrichsruh, Bismarck, while out
driving, dropped into conversation with an old peasant
on the bad weather. ‘Yes,’ the latter remarked, in Low
German, ‘the good God has forgotten us altogether. He
gives us no summer, and takes away our Chancellor.’”</p>

<p>On the 5th of September I had a visit from Bucher,
who had returned from Laubbach on the 3rd or 4th, and
on the 6th I called upon him. Of his communications
the most noteworthy is that at Friedrichsruh he found a
letter from Hermann Wagener to the Prince, from which
it appeared that, as far back as 1876, W. was instructed
to draw up a memorandum on working class insurance.
At that time, when Bismarck doubtless first seriously
took up the labour question and thought of positive
measures for opposing the Social Democracy, it was the
old <cite lang="de">Kreuzzeitung</cite> man who was his assistant and
counsellor, and not Bucher, who belonged to the school
of Lassalle and Rodbertus, as alleged by Poschinger.
Bucher expressly denied that the Chancellor had ever
discussed this question with him. On the 20th of
September Bucher wrote to me that he had received an
invitation to visit Bismarck at Varzin.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I received the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Varzin</span>, <i>October 3rd</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Busch</span>,&mdash;I have delivered your message.
He is glad you are better, and wishes you permanent
recovery. Here the condition of affairs is the same as
at Friedrichsruh. Nothing is being done and much
time is spent over the newspapers. Owing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span>
articles in Nos. 431 and 433 of the <cite lang="de">Boersenzeitung</cite>,
referred to in No. 459, a desire has been expressed to
see the numbers of the <cite lang="de">Grenzboten</cite> which started the
controversy&mdash;reproaching the bourgeoisie with opposing
the paternal intentions of the Sovereign. Can you lend
us the numbers in question from your file, or, if you
have not got them, procure copies from Grunow?
Lord Rosebery, who ran across from Scotland, was here
for a few days, and is now visiting Danzig and Marienburg.
With lots of good wishes,</p>

<p class="signature">
“<span class="smcap">Bucher</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>... In another letter from Bucher of October 14th,
the following passage occurs: “The Chief still occupies
himself far too much with the press. In the meantime
he has begun to dictate during the past few days, but
without any real coherence, alternately from various
years. It is, therefore, for the present, only raw material.
Now and again news reaches here from the Foreign
Office. Holstein, who for ten years was taken seriously
by nobody, now does everything. He not only slanders
the Prince, which he did twelve months since, but also
abuses Herbert, who, with inconceivable blindness, had
supported him up to the last. Paul Hatzfeldt too,
Sardanapalus as his cousin Landsberg christened him,
has proclaimed his apostacy in London. But I will also
mention a decent man, Count Arco, Minister at Washington,
who is here on a visit for a few days. <i lang="la" title="Rare bird!">Rara avis!</i>”</p>

<p>I sent him a long jocular epistle congratulating him
on his birthday on the 25th of October. But I received
no answer for over seven weeks, and was already worrying
myself with all sorts of fancies, when on the morning
of the 22nd of December he himself called upon me. He
told me that physically the Prince was in excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span>
health, and, as it appeared, took exercise, had a good
appetite, and at table drank rather too much than too
little, and besides he no longer complained of insomnia.
Mentally, however, and in particular so far as his memory
is concerned, “he is falling to pieces.” By this Bucher
meant that he could no longer concentrate his thoughts
sufficiently, had no longer a firm hold of the details in a
narrative, and was easily turned aside from his subject.
He also tells a story one way to-day, and quite differently
to-morrow. “He wished me to go to Friedrichsruh for
Christmas, but they gave me to understand&mdash;and indeed
very plainly&mdash;that that would not be agreeable to them;
and so I am my own master for a couple of weeks.” “Urged
by Schweninger he has at length decided to dictate his
reminiscences to me for an hour daily, when I take them
down in shorthand. But they are merely disconnected
fragments, and contain many errors, particularly in the
matter of dates. For instance, there were some very
interesting particulars respecting 1848, but they must first
be compared with Wolf’s ‘Chronik’ and corrected. Chrysander
is making himself very useful, also in his capacity of
doctor, and has, for instance, done me good service with
my gout. The Prince has ascertained on good authority
that Lindau has been to the <i lang="de">Korrespondenten</i> (or the
<cite lang="de">Nachrichten</cite>) in Hamburg, and the <cite lang="de">Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>
in Munich, setting them against his old Chief and patron,
and ‘threatening’ the latter paper with disciplinary
measures if it continued to take the Chancellor’s part.
The Princess’s ‘dear Rudchen,’ who for other people
is a shameless Judas! Kayser, his countryman from
the East, who is indeed less of a stock jobber and less
worthless for official purposes, was recommended to the
Foreign Office by Herbert, while Raschdau, also one of
the children of Israel, who has married a millionairess of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span>
his tribe, was&mdash;if I understood Bucher rightly&mdash;introduced
by Bill. (...) I asked what the Prince
thought of Caprivi. He only knew that the Chief had
had an interview with his successor (doubtless while he
was still in Berlin&mdash;at lunch), when Caprivi said that if
the Emperor sent him with an army corps into a
position where its destruction might be anticipated, he
would remonstrate; if the order were then repeated, he
would remain at his post and await events. Bucher
feared that nothing would come of the projected autobiography.
‘He has indeed dictated quite a pile of
notes, which of course include a great deal of new and
valuable matter; but his account is not always reliable,
and in particular he often believes that he said or did
something which he ought to have said or done but
omitted to do, or at least could not have said or done in
the manner alleged by him. And in the most important
matters he sometimes stops, like a well that
runs dry, and does not return to the subject. In that
way he recently began to speak of his relations with
Napoleon previous to 1870, but then let the subject
drop, and since then I have never been able to bring
him to give a coherent account of it. There is yet
another drawback. In these notes he might think of
history, of a legacy for the future, and that would
certainly be most praiseworthy and useful, as there are
many things of which he alone has a complete and accurate
knowledge. But he seems to be thinking rather of
something else. His thoughts are still with the present,
which he desires to influence. He wishes to warn and
to teach, and for that reason he often selects a subject
that has nothing whatever to do with his own life, and
sometimes one of which he has not a thorough knowledge,
but which seems to him to offer a suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span>
opportunity for introducing his own reflections. For
instance, he is afraid that the Emperor will not be
careful and thoughtful enough in tacking between
Vienna and St. Petersburg, and may, perhaps, on some
occasion forget himself and draw too near to the
Austrians; all the more, as of course he is aware that
the gentleman in Berlin cannot endure the other in
St. Petersburg, because the latter had treated him
somewhat <i lang="fr" title="up and down">de haut en bas</i>. Now Bismarck does not
want to say that straight out and give a plain warning,
but tries to work it into a survey of the treaty of
Reichenbach, as the relations were then somewhat
similar, the people in Berlin not rightly knowing what
they wanted or with whom they really had to deal.
The idea was merely to show that one was also a
power&mdash;(in English) a mere show of power! I have now
read it up in Ranke, however, and according to him the
situation was not all as the Chief represented it. At
that time, Herzberg still had charge of the conduct of
affairs, and he knew exactly what he wanted, namely,
Danzig and other towns on the Vistula, in order to
round off West Prussia.’”</p>

<p>Bucher continued: “What I have done up to the
present could be done equally well by any shorthand
writer, the only difference being that yet another
stranger would have to be taken into his confidence.
But I have no taste for criticising and editing, however
much Schweninger may beg and urge me to do so.
That would be too much trouble and responsibility.
Besides, there are not the necessary books for reference
and comparison. It is true that for twenty-five years
hardly a historical or political book has been published
of which a copy has not been sent to him, but she has
acted as librarian and has divided them between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span>
different rooms, putting some of them in the cellar, where
they rot and fall to pieces, and others in the visitors’
apartments, so that nothing can be found when it is
wanted.”</p>

<p>Bucher agreed with me that the Chief was not
prudent in his dealings with the eavesdroppers of the
press; that his attitude towards the Court was not
sufficiently dignified, and that he let his anger be too
easily seen. At the same time, Bucher, speaking of
those who came to question the Prince, observed, not
inaptly: “Whoever wants to know much learns a great
deal, even though it be not always unadulterated truth,
and that applies with particular force to the commercial
travellers for newspaper firms, who, of course, do not
deal in truth.” As to the Prince’s state of feeling,
Bucher said: “He diligently reads the newspapers, but
on the whole he is indifferent to politics. ‘I am no
longer so very much interested even in the management
of my own estate.’ There is no longer the old devil-may-care
spirit arising from that high sense of easy
superiority and ready power of mastery&mdash;no longer the
unconcerned glance cast down as from a great height,
but only apathetic indifference, weary satiety.”</p>

<p><i>January 2nd, 1891.</i>&mdash;Called on Bucher this morning.
Schweninger is trying to provide the Prince with
occupation on hygienic grounds. He fears that otherwise
he would become still more sulky, cross-grained,
and peevish, and, indeed, might in the end become
mentally affected. (...)</p>

<p>In the course of conversation on the Prince’s notes,
Bucher, in speaking of their didactic aim, referred to
Nicoll’s “Recollections and Reflections” as a model for
that kind of writing. He believes he must soon return
to Friedrichsruh, “although it will probably lead to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span>
nothing.” “God grant that there may be an improvement!”
he sighed on our parting at the door. I
heartily joined in that prayer.</p>

<p>It was not until the 21st of February that I again
received a sign of life from Bucher, and then in the
form of an unsigned note enclosed in an envelope to
Hedwig. It ran: “You will probably soon receive an
invitation to the place from which I write. The
enclosure is for publication, with an introduction or note
to the effect that the letter was read to the guests on
the 28/7/72, and that several of them took copies of it.
Do not forget to write to G. to impress upon the sub-editorial
ass and on the proof-readers that not a single
letter is to be omitted, and that the abbreviations, &amp;c.,
and the Latin characters in ‘Borussia’ and ‘Material’
are to be retained. The Chief will have it so. If you
happen to write to me, remember the Dark Cabinet.”</p>

<p>The “enclosure,” a letter from the Emperor William
I., ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Coblenz</span>, <i>July 26, 1872</i>.

<p>“On the 28th instant you will celebrate a beautiful
family festival which God in His mercy has granted to
you. I may not, and cannot, withhold my sympathy
on this occasion, and therefore you and the Princess,
your consort, will accept my heartiest and warmest congratulations
on this elevating festival. That your
domestic happiness should always have held the first
place among the numerous blessings which Providence
has elected to bestow upon you both&mdash;it is for this that
your prayers of thanksgiving should rise to Heaven!
But our and my prayers of thanksgiving go further,
inasmuch as they include thanks to God for having
placed you at my side at a decisive moment, and thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span>
opened up a path for my Government far beyond imagination
and understanding. But you will return
thanks to Heaven for this also&mdash;that God granted you
to achieve such great things. And in and after all
your labours you have constantly found recreation and
peace in your home. It is that which sustains you in
your difficult vocation. My constant anxiety for you is
that you should preserve and strengthen yourself for

</div>


<p>On the 23rd of February I again received a letter from
Bucher, also under cover to Frau Hedwig Hämmerling:
“23/2/91. He says he would like to see you once more,
and requests you to visit him. You may choose the
time most convenient to yourself, but give two days’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span>
notice in advance, so as to avoid clashing with an
invitation to Hamburg. Be sure to bring your sleeping
garments with you, if you are as little in favour with
the lady of the house as I am.”</p>

<p>I replied that I should have preferred to go the day
after to-morrow, but that as I was at liberty to name my
own time, and was now engaged in reading over papers,
arranging and packing for my removal on the 16th of
March, I would come on the 18th. I further requested
him to say by what train I should come, and called
attention to the fine cartoon and verses, “Dropping the
Pilot,” in <cite>Punch</cite>, of the 29th of March, 1890, which
an acquaintance had sent me the previous day, and
which I should bring with me if they had not already
seen it.</p>

<p>Bucher replied that they had the “Pilot” from
<cite>Punch</cite> at Friedrichsruh; and that he himself had
travelled by the slow train. I arrived at Friedrichsruh
at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 18th of March. The Prince had gone
out for a drive with Buhl, the member of Parliament,
who had come on a visit. A servant showed me upstairs
to No. 4 as my room, where Grant, Bancroft, and
the busts of Washington and Hamilton kept me
company. I immediately visited Bucher, whose room
was opposite mine. He complained that the work of
the “Memoirs” stood exactly where it did before. In
dictating, the Prince wandered from one point to
another, told many things several times, and almost
always differently, &amp;c. A huge pile of dictated notes
had already been transcribed, he calculated some sixty
printed sheets. It would, however, have to be sifted
and worked up, and the Chief had not as yet looked
through a line of it. Hardly anything would come of it,
and, in any case, he had not as yet decided whether it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span>
should be published during his lifetime or after his
death. Bucher intends to leave again for a time at the
end of the month, and is very dissatisfied with his
occupation hitherto. He showed me in the pile on the
chair a thick packet, endorsed, “Nikolsburg,” and
observed that it dealt less with the important events that
took place there than with a variety of other matters.
He had seen few of the papers arranged by me in 1888,
none at all of those relating to the alliance with
Austria, only two or three letters from the Gerlach
correspondence, and he had also seen nothing of
the correspondence with Manteuffel and Schleinitz.
He believes that the Chief has sent all those that
are missing to a bank in England for safety. But a
few days later he modified this surmise, and said he
thought the papers were in the keeping of some trusty
friend.</p>

<p>Downstairs before dinner, Buhl, a lean old gentleman
with a grey beard, introduced himself to me. I
now made the acquaintance also of Dr. Chrysander, a
slight young man. The Chief appeared shortly afterwards
with the Princess. He greeted me with the
customary “Büschlein,” was pleased to see from my
appearance that I was well again, and said I must sit
next to him at table on his right, while President Buhl
sat on his left between himself and his consort. The
Prince looked very well, was most good-humoured and
talkative during dinner, was surprised that I still had so
much hair, told amusing stories and expatiated with
knowledge on various fine wines and judges thereof.
(...)</p>

<p>Dinner was followed by some more serious conversation
in the coffee-room. In reply to a question by Buhl
the Prince disapproved of Caprivi’s East African policy:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p. 353]</span>
“Zanzibar ought not to have been left to the English.
It would have been better to maintain the old arrangement.
We could then have had it at some later time
when England required our good offices against France
or Russia. In the meantime our merchants, who are
cleverer, and, like the Jews, are satisfied with smaller
profits, would have kept the upper hand in business.
To regard Heligoland as an equivalent shows more
imagination than sound calculation. In the event of
war it would be better for us that it should be in the
hands of a neutral Power. It is difficult and most
expensive to fortify”&mdash;a point which he then explained
in detail. “That does not make one an ‘extender of
the realm,’ not even to the extent that I was in the old
days when I travelled back to Berlin with the cession of
a strip of land on the Jahde in my pocket, thinking not
a little of my achievement!” The Prince is also
opposed to building any more large ships: “rather two
small vessels than one big one; the North Sea and
Baltic Canal doubles our naval strength.” (...)</p>

<p>On Friday, March 20th, after lunch, at which the
Chief was again very bright and communicative, Bucher
at my request allowed me to read the chapter on Nikolsburg
from the material dictated for the “Memoirs,” in the
first place that I should note the numerous digressions
from the real subject. These excursions included, among
other things, references to the anti-German Queen of
Holland, intended annexations, Frederick the Great, an
intrigue during the Regency, the indemnity, the impression
made in Russia by the events of the summer of
1866, the Danzig Pronunciamento, the German question
in 1848, dynastic sentiments, a lost opportunity in 1848,
factions, the <cite lang="de">Wochenblatt</cite> party, Augusta, the removal
to St. Petersburg and the Italian war. In doing this I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span>
ran through the greater part of the manuscript, and
found some new and interesting matter respecting the
King’s desire for annexation, Bismarck’s reasons for
moderation, and a speedy conclusion of peace; Moltke’s
strategic plans; a visit of the Crown Prince, who comes
to Bismarck and promises to support him at a time when
he was almost despairing of carrying through his scheme;
and the final consent of the King, who complains, however,
that it is an “ignominious peace.” Further
matters of interest are: Augusta’s influence on the
Regent, Bismarck’s audience before his transfer to St.
Petersburg, his condemnation of the Ministers of the
new era, as for instance of Schwerin, and afterwards of
Usedom and his English wife; the remarkable allegation
that Frederick the Great was also vain, supported by
references to the King’s own judgment of a poem written
by himself immediately after the battle (“<i lang="fr">n’est pas trop
mal après une bataille</i>”), and to his flute playing. In
conclusion, the views expressed as to our relations with
Austria and Russia, and the policy which they impose
upon us, well deserve to be taken to heart. Irritation
against the Russians has arisen (this doubtless refers to
the Emperor William) out of personal impressions (due
to inadequate appreciation); yet we cannot be quite
certain of Austria, as the possibility of a breach with her
depends upon one person. Bucher says that the Chief
would doubtless speak to me about Windthorst, as to
whom there were still many things to be said, and suggested
that I should start the subject when opportunity
offered. This was done indirectly over our coffee after
dinner, but the Prince did not take it up. Later on,
however, it was suggested that such excessive honours
would never have been paid to the old Guelph advocate
at his death if the Emperor had not set the example.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span>
To-day the Chief dictated to Bucher on “questions of
State rights,” but was unable to get properly under way
and could not verify or complete what he had to say, as
he had not got his books, “his tools.” (...)</p>

<p>At noon on Saturday, the 21st of March, the Chief
sent Bucher, to whom he had again been dictating in the
morning on questions of State rights, to ask if I would
go for a walk with him. (...)</p>

<p>I took an opportunity of inquiring how his “Memoirs”
were getting on, mentioning that I knew he had begun
to dictate his reminiscences and views. “That is so,”
he rejoined; “but it is probable that in the end it will
come to nothing. I have no documents, and even if I
remember the main points&mdash;quite clearly&mdash;one cannot
after all carry in his head every detail of what has
happened in the course of thirty years. Then as to the
publication during my lifetime. Ever since 1847 I have
constantly represented the monarchical principle, and
held it aloft like a banner. Now I have seen three Kings
in a state of nakedness, and frequently these three
exalted gentlemen did not make altogether a very good
show. Still it would not do to say that openly before
the world&mdash;it would be inconsistent&mdash;opposed to principle.
And yet I can just as little keep silent when once
I come to deal with that point, to say nothing of asserting
the contrary. And if it (the publication) takes place
after my death, then they will say: ‘There you have it!
Even from his grave! What a detestable old wretch!’”
I could only reply that one has duties towards himself,
and his own honour,&mdash;duties towards that which one has
created; that one ought as a man of experience and
judgment to warn the country against wrong courses
into which it may be led through the impetuousness or
thoughtlessness and excessive self-confidence of new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span>
politicians; and furthermore that one has duties towards
history, to dispel misunderstandings and chimeras, and
the falsehoods of flattering courtiers; and that truth,
which stands above all things, must have its rights&mdash;truth
of which Jesus said that it will make us free. He
listened in silence to this eager and audacious outburst;
and I then spoke of another subject&mdash;namely, Kingston’s
report in the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> of an interview with him,
and in particular of the very favourable opinion of the
Emperor Frederick, therein ascribed to him, which could
not be reconciled with the views I had heard him express.
He replied: “I know nothing of any Kingston, or of any
interview in an English newspaper. The report must be
an invention (<i lang="de">Schwindel</i>).” He then mentioned the
picture (in <cite>Punch</cite>), “Dropping the Pilot,” and said:
“The Emperor was delighted with it. He saw in it a recognition
of his right to smash the pot&mdash;you know as in the
witches’ kitchen: ‘<i lang="de">Entzwei, entzwei, da liegt der Brei</i>.’”</p>

<p>At lunch among other things the Prince related the
history of some excellent old Jamaica rum, of which a
bottle stood on the table. The conversation then led to
a few corrections. It was Kayser and not Rudchen
Lindau who had warned and threatened the <cite lang="de">Allgemeine
Zeitung</cite> in Munich; and Bötticher had not told the lie
about the morphiomania of the Chancellor direct to the
Emperor, but to the Grand Duke of Baden, who then
related it to his Majesty. The statement that the latter
questioned Schweninger is true, as also the rough answer
given by the doctor. “And as a matter of fact,” said
the Chief, “I have only taken morphia when in great
pain, and it has never done me any harm; although
Bötticher asserted that he found me quite deranged
mentally and irresponsible for my actions.”</p>

<p>After dinner while reading the papers the Chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span>
remarked, I now forget in what connection: “One day,
long after my death, Büschlein will write the secret
history of our times from good sources.” “Yes, Serene
Highness,” I replied, “but not a real history&mdash;I cannot
do that&mdash;rather a compilation of good materials, conscientiously
collected and placed in a proper light. Nor
shall it be long after your death, which of course we
pray may be as remote as possible, but immediately,
without delay, as in these corrupt times one cannot too
soon vindicate the rights of truth.” He then came to
speak of the newspaper reports to the effect that more
friendly relations were gradually growing up between
himself and the Emperor, a statement which he denied
as something obviously impossible. He referred to the
new communal regulations, which he disapproved of.
He said they had offended the farmers, whom they put
on a level with the small traders and artisans in communal
affairs. He then spoke at some length of Minister
Herrfurth, addressing himself for the most part to
me, much to the following effect (Bucher afterwards
recapitulated his statement to me upstairs): while the
Emperor was still Prince and lived at Potsdam, he,
Bismarck, desired to prepare him for the government,
and to provide him, so to say, with tuition in the various
branches of the art of governing. Up to that time
he knew little, and indeed did not trouble himself
much about it, but preferred to enjoy himself in the
society of young officers and suchlike. The plan was to
get him to remove to Berlin, somewhere near Bellevue.
But the financial authorities at Court were of opinion
that that would be too expensive. The Prince was then
to hear lectures at Potsdam, and Bismarck proposed
Herrfurth, the Under-Secretary of State,&mdash;who was reputed
to be well informed, particularly in statistics&mdash;as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span>
his tutor on internal questions. The Prince agreed
and invited Herrfurth to lunch with him, and then told
the Chancellor he could not stand him, with his bristly
beard, his dryness and tediousness, and asked whether
the Prince could not suggest some one else. Yes, he
would send him <i lang="de">Regierungsrath</i> von Brandenstein.
The Prince had nothing to say against that, so Brandenstein
was written to. But <abbr title="His Royal Highness">H.R.H.</abbr>, although it is true
he lunched with him several times, paid so little attention
to his explanations that Herr von Brandenstein lost
patience, and begged to be given some other employment.
In the meantime, shortly before the death of
the Emperor Frederick, Minister Puttkamer was dismissed.
When Prince William ascended the throne
Bismarck spoke to him on the subject, and he said he
would of course make Puttkamer Minister again, but a
certain interval must be allowed to elapse&mdash;for appearance
sake. Bismarck proposed that Herrfurth should
hold the post in the interval, and told him that he must
carry on the policy which Puttkamer had adopted, and
resign his place to the latter after a certain time, receiving
in return a post of Chief President. Would he
agree to that? Yes, he would; he had always followed
the course laid down by his superior, Puttkamer, and
would willingly make way for him when the time came.
But when Bismarck, after a few weeks or months, observed
to his Majesty that the time had come to reinstate
Puttkamer, the Emperor replied, no, he did not
think of doing so any longer, as he had in the meantime
grown accustomed to Herrfurth, and was now quite
satisfied with him. The change had come about in this
way. Herrfurth had, without previous consultation with
the Prime Minister, put himself in direct communication
with the Emperor, and taking advantage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span>
Sovereign’s wishes, recommended a liberal reform of the
Communal Regulations, as a measure by which he could
gain numerous friends and secure imperishable fame.
“After a few days,” concluded the Prince, “my Schönhausen
people came to me and asked, ‘What does this
mean?’ They had received papers, and were, it would
seem, to report whether they desired to have all the old
arrangements upset, and every one put on the same
level. And this was done throughout the seven old
provinces, much to the surprise and dissatisfaction of
the peasantry. That too was one of the causes of my
retirement.” The Chief afterwards said that when I
left he wished to give me some papers to take with me
and keep for him. I was to make copies of them, which
I could publish at a future day. I promised to remind
him, and also offered my services for other purposes in
the future; “I had always regarded myself as his little
archer, who at his call would even shoot my bolt at the
sun himself.” He smiled, and said: “Many thanks,
perhaps.”</p>

<p><i>Sunday, March 22nd.</i>&mdash;During the forenoon the
Chief dictated to Bucher some notes on the question as
to how the German Constitution might be altered in
case it should no longer work. He also told him that
he wished to give me certain important documents to
take with me. (...)</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 23rd.</i>&mdash;(...) I had waited yesterday
in vain to see the Chief on his return from lunch
to his study, in order to remind him of the documents
which I was to take with me. To-day, after lunch, I
called upon him in his own room for this purpose. I
apologised for disturbing him, but, as I intended to
leave to-morrow, I thought it was of importance to him
that I should take the papers with me. “So it is,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span>
rejoined, “and it is well that you have reminded me of
it while I am alone. But why are you going away so
soon?” “I do not wish to be any longer a burden to
you, Serene Highness.” “But you are nothing of the
kind. On the contrary, I am glad to see such a faithful
old comrade of the war time; and, moreover, you are so
quiet that you disturb no one.” We then agreed that I
should remain for a few days longer, and remind him of
the papers once more later on. (...)</p>

<p>During the day workmen were engaged unpacking
large cases of silver plate&mdash;a valuable treasure which
German manufacturers had presented to the Prince as a
token of their esteem. At dinner the old gentleman,
who still remains the same lover of nature and of
animals, had a great deal to tell about the starlings,
for whom he had had a few dozen small wooden shelters
put up in the trees behind the house. “They held a
public meeting to-day,” he said, “probably in connection
with the approach of spring. As I was going for my
walk I first saw seven of them sitting together in one
place and making music. Shortly after their numbers
increased, and finally there were thirty of them sitting
together, wing to wing.” He then cast a glance at the
grey bull-dog waltzing round the room, and observed,
“That reminds me of the funeral honours paid to Windthorst.
I should never have thought of getting him
(the dog), but the Emperor presented him to me. If it
had not been for the Emperor’s intervention at the
beginning, they would never have made such a fuss
about Windthorst.” After dinner the conversation
turned on newspaper tattle, as, for instance, that he
had sent twelve cases full of important papers to an
English bank to keep for him. “Twelve!” he exclaimed,
smiling, “I wish I had even one such case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span>
full.” The gossips of the press also reported that he
had recently purchased a house in Berlin, such and such
a number in the Königgrätzerstrasse&mdash;better informed
authorities had it that it was two houses&mdash;at a very
high price. From this he went on to say that they
once assessed the rent of his palace (the Palais Radziwill)
in the Wilhelmstrasse (for the inhabited house
duty) at 50,000 marks. On his remonstrating, they
replied that the English Ambassador had assessed his
own house, which was not so large, at as high a figure.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of Tuesday, March 24th, the Chief
sent upstairs for me and handed me, first, three metallographic
copies of documents, with two letters and a
memorandum. All these were from the year 1885, and
referred to the protection of municipalities against
arbitrary school rates. “They are metallographs,” he
said, “and as such I dare say I may publish them at
some future time. You can take them with you for
that purpose, but they should be returned to me afterwards.”
“Then I will copy them.” “Yes, but that
means a great deal of work, twenty or more pages, in
parts closely written.” “That does not matter, it shall
be done.” “And then here is my resignation, and this
is the statement of my motives. You may read that
through&mdash;” (and, as I boldly assume, with tacit permission
to take a copy away with me, at present merely
for my own information). “This is about Herbert&mdash;you
can read that also, and then bring them all back to
me.” I went immediately to my room and began to
copy the resignation and the statement of motives, as
well as the answer of the Chief to the Imperial acceptance
thereof, which he had given me instead of the
paper referring to Herbert. The metallographic documents
will be dealt with later on.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Resignation.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“B(erlin) 18.3.90.&mdash;On the occasion of my respectful
report of the 15th instant, your Majesty commanded
me to submit the draft of an Order which should revoke
the Royal Order of the 8th of September, 1852, by
which the relations between the Minister President and
his colleagues have hitherto been regulated.</p>

<p>“I take the liberty most humbly to submit the following
statement of the origin and significance of this
Order. Under the absolute Monarchy the office of a
President of the Ministry of State was not required;
and it was in 1847, in the United Diet, that the Liberal
members of that time (Mevissen) first pointed to the
necessity of paving the way for constitutional arrangements
by the appointment of a ‘Prime Minister’
(‘Premier Minister’), whose task it should be to take
charge of and provide for the maintenance of a uniform
policy by the responsible Ministry, and to undertake
responsibility for the entire results of the policy of the
Cabinet. This constitutional arrangement came into
force with us in 1848, and the ‘President of the Ministry
of State,’&mdash;in succession Count Arnim, Camphausen,
Count Brandenburg, Baron von Manteuffel, and the
Prince of Hohenzollern,&mdash;was responsible in the first
place not for any single department, but for the entire
policy of the Cabinet, and, therefore, for the departments,
as a whole. Most of these gentlemen had no
separate department but only the Presidency, as for
instance, prior to my entrance into office, the Prince of
Hohenzollern, Minister von Auerswald and Prince von
Hohenlohe. It was their duty, however, to maintain
that unity and continuity in the Ministry of State itself
and in the relations between the latter and the monarchy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span>
without which Ministerial responsibility, such as arises
under a constitutional system, would be an impossibility.
The relations of the Ministry of State and its individual
members to their newly instituted Minister President,
however, soon required to be regulated in more strict
accordance with the Constitution. This was done, in
concurrence with the Ministry of State, in the
Order of the 8th of September, 1852. Since that
time this Order had governed the relations of the
Minister President to the Ministry of State, and
through it alone the Minister President was invested
with the authority which enabled him to assume
that degree of responsibility for the policy of the Cabinet
as a whole which was attributed to him in the Diet and
by public opinion. If each individual Minister can
receive commands from the Sovereign without previous
arrangement with his colleagues, a coherent policy in
the Cabinet, for which some one is to be responsible,
is an impossibility. It would be impossible for any of
the Ministers, and especially for the Minister President,
to bear the constitutional responsibility for the Cabinet
as a whole. Such a provision as that contained in the
Order of 1852 could be dispensed with under the absolute
monarchy, and could also be dispensed with to-day
if we returned to absolutism without Ministerial responsibility.
But according to the constitutional
arrangements now legally in force, the control of the
Cabinet by a President under the Order of 1852 is
indispensable. All my colleagues agree with me upon
this point, as is shown by yesterday’s sitting of the
Ministry of State, and also that no one who succeeds me
as Minister President can assume responsibility for his
office if he lacks the authority vested in him by the
Order of 1852. This necessity will be felt even more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span>
strongly by any succeeding Minister than by me, as he
will not be immediately sustained by that authority
which I have hitherto enjoyed, owing to my long tenure
of the Presidency and to the confidence reposed in me
by the two late Emperors. Up to the present it has
never been necessary for me, in dealing with my
colleagues, to expressly appeal to the Order of 1852.
Its existence and the certainty that I possessed the confidence
of the two late Emperors, William and Frederick,
was sufficient to secure my authority in the Cabinet.
To-day, however, this certainty exists neither for my
colleagues nor myself. I have therefore been obliged
to fall back upon that Order for the purpose of securing
the necessary unity in your Majesty’s service. For the
reasons stated above, I am not in a position to carry out
your Majesty’s command in accordance with which I
should myself introduce and countersign the revocation
of the Order of 1852 (to which I myself recently called
attention), and nevertheless continue to hold the
Presidency of the Ministry of State.</p>

<p>“According to the communications made to me
yesterday by Lieutenant-General Hahnke and <i lang="de">Geheimer
Kabinetsrath</i> von Lucanus, I can entertain no doubt
that your Majesty knows and believes that it is not
possible for me to revoke the Order and yet remain
Minister President. Notwithstanding that fact your
Majesty has maintained the command given on the 15th
instant and indicated that my resignation, which is
thereby rendered necessary, would be accepted. From
previous conferences which I had with your Majesty
on the question whether your Majesty desired my continuance
in office, I gathered that it would be agreeable
to your Majesty that I should resign my position in the
service of Prussia, but continue in that of the Empire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span>
After considering this matter more closely I took the
liberty to call attention to some critical consequences
of such a division of my offices, particularly so far as
the future action of the Chancellor in the Imperial
Diet is concerned, and therefore refrain from repeating
here all the consequences which would attend such a
divorce between Prussia and the Imperial Chancellor.
Thereupon your Majesty deigned to agree that for the
present everything should remain as it was.</p>

<p>“As I have had the honour to explain, however, it is
not possible for me to retain the post of Minister
President after your Majesty has repeatedly ordered
it to be subjected to the <i lang="la" title="reduction of status">capitis diminutio</i> involved in
the revocation of the fundamental Order of 1852.</p>

<p>“On the occasion of my respectful report of the
15th instant your Majesty was pleased to confine me, as
regards the extent of my official authority, within
limits which do not allow me that degree of participation
in the affairs of State, that supervision of the
latter, and that freedom in my Ministerial decisions and
in my intercourse with the Imperial Diet and its
members, which I require if I am to accept constitutional
responsibility for my official acts.</p>

<p>“But even if it were possible to carry on our foreign
policy so independently of our home policy, and our
Imperial policy so independently of Prussian policy,
as would be the case if the Imperial Chancellor had
as little share in the policy of Prussia as in that of
Bavaria and Saxony, and had nothing to do in the
Imperial Diet with the decision as to the Prussian
vote in the Federal Council, it would nevertheless&mdash;after
your Majesty’s recent decisions on the direction
of our foreign policy, as laid down in the confidential
letter with which your Majesty yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span>
accompanied the report of the Consul at Kieff&mdash;be
impossible for me to undertake to carry out the instructions
respecting foreign affairs contained therein.
I should thereby endanger all the important results for
the German Empire, which our foreign policy, in agreement
with the views of your Majesty’s two predecessors,
has for decades past under difficult circumstances secured
in our relations with Russia, results that have attained
a significance beyond all expectations great for the present
and for the future, a circumstance which was confirmed
by Count Schuvaloff after his return from St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>“Attached as I am to the service of the Royal House
and of your Majesty, and accustomed for many years to
conditions which I have hitherto regarded as permanent,
it is very painful to me to sever my wonted relations
with your Majesty, and to break off my connection with
the entire policy of the Empire of Prussia. Nevertheless,
after conscientiously weighing your Majesty’s intentions,
which I should have to be prepared to carry
out if I were to remain in office, I have no alternative
but most humbly to beg your Majesty graciously to
relieve me of the offices of Imperial Chancellor and of
Minister President, and Prussian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, under the usual regulations as to pension.</p>

<p>“From my impressions of the last few weeks and
the communications made to me yesterday by your
Majesty’s Civil and Military Cabinet, I may respectfully
take it for granted that I meet your Majesty’s views in
thus tendering my resignation, and therefore that
I may reckon with certainty upon its being graciously
accepted.</p>

<p>“I would have submitted to your Majesty the petition
to be relieved of my offices a year ago if I had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span>
been under the impression that your Majesty desired to
take advantage of the experience and capacity of a
faithful servant of your predecessors. Now that I am
assured your Majesty does not require them, I may
retire from political life without fearing that public
opinion will condemn my decision as untimely.</p>

<p>At the present stage of international affairs I consider
it hazardous to publish the “Draft of confidential
statement as to the motives of my retirement from
office.” The interest of Germany in keeping it secret
for the immediate future seems to me to be greater than
the interest of history in its publication now.</p>


<h3 title="Notes on my Retirement">“<span class="smcap">Notes on my Retirement.</span></h3>

<p>“The Vice-President of the Ministry of State (von
Bötticher) declared that he and his colleagues were
deeply grieved at my retirement. He had hitherto
hoped that the only differences of opinion between his
Majesty and myself were connected with home domestic
policy, and therefore that the arrangement indicated by
me, namely, that I should confine myself to the control
of foreign affairs, would prove a satisfactory solution.
My withdrawal from all my offices involved incalculable
difficulties; and although he could understand my displeasure,
he could only beg me urgently to come to a
compromise.</p>

<p>“I replied: The expedient of withdrawing from the
Prussian service and confining myself to the position of
Imperial Chancellor had met with objections from the
Federal Governments and the Imperial Diet. It is felt
to be desirable that the Chancellor should have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span>
official position in which he can control the casting of
the Prussian vote; and I, too, could not accept a position
in which I should be obliged to take from the
Prussian Ministers instructions in the preparation of
which I had had no part. Therefore this expedient also
would not be free from difficulties.</p>

<p>“The Minister of Finance declared that the Order
of the 8th of September, 1852, by no means went beyond
what was necessary, and could not form an insurmountable
difficulty. And also so far as the difficulties
in the matter of foreign affairs were concerned, he could
only agree with the Minister of State, von Bötticher,
that a compromise ought to be sought. Besides, if the
retirement took place not for reasons of health, but on
political grounds, and from all offices, then the Ministry
of State itself would have to consider whether it should
not take part in this step. Perhaps that would contribute
to avert the fatal event.</p>

<p>“The Ministers of Public Worship and of Justice
considered that the differences referred to were due
solely to a misunderstanding, which it might be possible
to clear up for his Majesty. The Minister of War
added, that for a long time past his Majesty had not
let fall a single word that had any reference to warlike
complications with Russia.</p>

<p>“The Minister of Public Works (Maybach) described
my retirement as a misfortune for the security of the
country and the peace of Europe. Every possible effort
should be made to avert it. In these circumstances he
considered that the Ministers should place their offices
at the disposal of his Majesty, and he at least was
determined to do so.</p>

<p>“The Minister for Agriculture declared that if I
were convinced that my retirement was desired in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span>
highest quarter I could not be dissuaded from this step.
But in any case the Ministry would then have to
consider what course it should adopt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 25th.</i>&mdash;The Chief started for
Hamburg to-day, first to pay a return visit to Waldersee
at Altona, and afterwards to make a few calls in
Hamburg. He had not left, however, before lunch, at
which he joined us, in undress uniform and wearing an
order. He was back again in time for dinner. He had not
found Waldersee at home, and at the other houses also
had only met the ladies. At table there was a great
deal of talk about the torchlight procession with which
the Prince’s Hamburg admirers wished to celebrate his
birthday here on the 1st of April. It was anticipated
that 3,000 to 4,000 persons would come to Friedrichsruh
by special trains to take part in the procession. They
could marshal their torches and go through their evolutions
with tolerable ease in the meadows on the right
bank of the Aue.</p>

<p>At lunch the Chief said that after all it was not
necessary that I should copy the metallographic documents
here. I could do that at my leisure in Leipzig&mdash;a blessing,
as it would, otherwise, take me three days to do it, and
the Princess expects some visitors on the 28th, for whom
she wants my room. Therefore off and away at noon
to-morrow! Baron Merck and his wife, whom I have
known since 1888, were with us at dinner to-day.
Among other things the Prince spoke of his new silver-plate.
It was very rich and beautiful, but his household
was not at all prepared for it, and silver-plate and dishes
had never been used at his table. He would, perhaps,
have the chandeliers hung up, but the other things would
doubtless be sent to the bank for safe keeping.</p>

<p><i>Friday, March 27th.</i>&mdash;Took lunch alone, and somewhat
earlier than usual on account of my departure.
After a while the Princess, who was on this occasion
particularly good-humoured and communicative, came.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span>
Among other things she related that Schweninger’s
predecessor, a celebrated doctor recommended by
Bleichröder, had once treated the Prince for cancer of the
stomach; and that it is Versen and the “detestable
Hinzpeter” who have most influence with the Emperor
and who stimulate the high opinion he has of his own
capacity and encourage his arbitrary tendencies. Finally
the Prince also came in to say good-bye, and invited me
to report myself again shortly at Friedrichsruh. Then
back to Berlin, and a few days later, on the 2nd of April,
to Leipzig, my new home. (...)</p>

<p>I had hoped that at length I might rest, but it
was not to be. The mill must still grind on! Indeed,
there is no alternative, as people would not otherwise
know how I came to the extraordinary notion of writing
yet another book on Bismarck, and how that scheme
fared. On the 23rd of June <i lang="de">Kommerzienrath</i> Kröner,
of Stuttgart, previously only known to me by name,
called upon me and proposed that I should write for him
a biography of the Prince. I agreed to do so in case
the latter approved. With this object I next wrote the
following letter to Bucher, who was again at Friedrichsruh
with the old gentleman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,
</p>

<p class="extra">“I yesterday had a visit from a Stuttgart gentleman,
hitherto unknown to me, who asked if I would
write a biography of the Prince, three or four volumes;
I could speak out exactly as I liked, and also lay down
such other conditions as were convenient to me. As he
came direct from Friedrichsruh, and had there spoken
to the Prince and also to you, his intention in putting
this question to me was possibly known and approved
of at Friedrichsruh. If that be the case, and if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span>
Prince gives his permission, I am disposed to make the
attempt, particularly as I may then hope also to be
assisted with contributions on doubtful points. I would
take time and provide for complete freedom from interference
on the part of the publisher and would serve the
truth so far as it is known to me.</p>

<p>“Please, therefore, inquire to-day or to-morrow
whether he gives his blessing to the affair or not, and
let me know the result.” (...)</p>
</div>

<p>The following answer came from Bucher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Fr.</span> 26/7/91.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dr. Fr</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 24th, which curiously
enough bears the Leipzig postmark of the 26th, reached
me last evening, and I have this morning communicated
its contents. The reply ran literally: ‘I have
nothing whatever against it. I have sometimes a feeling
that the end will come suddenly for me one day. I
should like to have the opportunity of correcting many
errors <i lang="la">viva voce</i>, as Busch has a great deal of material.
Things are going badly with me. I have pains in my
hand, and other pains which I cannot write about.
When I have pushed the stone a little way uphill it
rolls back again to the bottom. I wish you better
luck.’”</p>
</div>

<p>On receipt of this information I finally agreed with
Kröner to write the book, and entered into a contract
with him. A few weeks later, however, in thinking
over the prospect, I was half sorry that I had done so,
and wrote to Bucher (pointing out certain objections in
the event of the Prince’s “Memoirs” being published, and
competing with the book: and suggesting that in case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span>
they were not to appear until after Bismarck’s death,
judicious extracts from them might be included in the
biography, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>Bucher’s reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Laubbach bei Coblenz</span>, <i>September 1, 1891</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Nothing will ever come of the
‘Memoirs,’ even if He<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and I were to live for ten years to
come. The chief hindrance is laziness, as He himself expresses
it. My work can only consist in dividing up the
chaos of dictated material, and uniting the pieces into
mosaics, as also in correcting his chronology, which is
quite untrustworthy, and of course falsifies the casual
relations of things. What He has to do is to read
over the chapters which I have put together, and at
the same time the letters referring to the subject, which
I put with them. He cannot, however, be brought to
do that. Of the fourteen chapters which I have submitted
to him since last September he had on my
departure from Kissingen read one through, and a
portion of another! In correcting his chronology in
four important instances I have forced him to acknowledge
that the affair cannot really have happened in the
way in which he had dictated it; but it was impossible
for me to squeeze out of him any statement as to what
actually had occurred. I am well-nigh desperate, and
should be very pleased if my work were stopped and
the whole thing handed over to you. I do not know
what he will think, but in any case make the attempt.</p>

<p>“Schweninger, who is very anxious to get him to
take up some serious, continuous occupation, persuaded
me to go to Kissingen, assuring me that he would keep
the two disturbing elements, the Princess and Herbert,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span>
at a distance; we two should have him to ourselves,
and he would therefore begin a new life. Nothing of
the kind has occurred. It was the old lazy life in the
Castle of Indolence (Schlaraffenleben)&mdash;guests and
drinking every day. And, as I had suspected, the baths
did me no good whatever. My right hand is greatly
swollen, and it is only since I repeated my former cure
here that a slight improvement is perceptible. In any
case I shall be back in Berlin at the beginning of
October, although He has expressed a wish that I
should go direct from here to Varzin. For months
together last year there was a temperature of 12 degrees
in my room there, and that has ruined me.</p>

<p class="signoff1">
“Ever yours (in English),</p>

<p class="signature">“B.”</p>
</div>

<p>I wrote in reply from Leipzig, on September 2nd,
1891, <i lang="la" title="among other things">inter alia</i>: that if the “Memoirs” were never to be
completed but remain mere materials, there was all
the more reason for rescuing at least a portion from
destruction.... I would do nothing in the matter
before consulting him, but I was not without hope that
the Chief would allow himself to be persuaded by my
arguments, and would assist me with the dictated
matter in my otherwise desperate undertaking. (...)</p>

<p>After some consideration, however, I addressed my
request to the Prince direct, ... and in the course
of a week, on the 17th of September, the following
answer came by post:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Varzin</span>, <i>September 14, 1891</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“I have received your letter, and will willingly
accede to your wish that I should&mdash;before its publication&mdash;look
through the work which you have arranged
to write. I cannot, however, as yet place what I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span>
myself written and dictated at your disposal. It is not
possible for the present to publish any part of it either
directly or indirectly. Even if made public in an indirect
way its accuracy would be questioned, and I
should be challenged to produce my proofs.</p>

<p>“I should be glad to receive a short provisional communication,
either written or verbal, as to the plan and
contents of the work.</p>

</div>

<p>(Probably written by Chrysander, but signed by the
Prince in his own hand. Not the most favourable
answer, still the “as yet” and “for the present” leaves
room for hope.) (...)</p>

<p>On the 5th of October I paid Bucher a visit in Berlin
in connection with this matter. I showed him the draft
of a reply I had sent within the course of a week to the
Chief, and he told me he had already been informed by
Schweninger. He said I ought first to have arranged
with him before writing to the Prince, and mentioning
his name. As it was, Bismarck would believe that he
had suggested my plan respecting the “Memoirs.” I was
mistaken in thinking that Kröner had come to me about
the biography with the knowledge and at the instance of
the Prince. Kröner (who hoped to secure the publication
of the “Memoirs”) probably thought I would enter
into competition with him, and therefore decided to come
to me, and thus become his own competitor. Not very
clear! As publisher of the “Memoirs” that will never be
completed, and which according to Bismarck’s verbal
and written assurances are never to be published? It
did not tally either with Bucher’s present statement that
the Prince was thinking of leaving two copies of the
“Memoirs,” one for the Emperor and one for his own sons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span>
Moreover, the text of these two could not be the same.
One of them would have to be first trimmed and
Bowdlerised, <i lang="la" title="not suitable for young people">in usum Delphini</i>, as&mdash;according to Bucher’s
own assertion&mdash;it contained a variety of things calculated
to give offence. Referring to the differences between the
Prince and the Emperor, Bucher stated that their origin
was to be sought in the following incident, as well as in
the demand with regard to the Order of 1852, and the
steps which&mdash;according to Bismarck’s statement&mdash;had
been taken in connection with Windthorst’s visit. (The
Prince’s account of the Windthorst incident appeared to
him, Bucher, not to be credible, at least so far as the
date was concerned.) On the 15th of March, as the
Emperor was returning home from a drive with Bismarck,
he told the latter that he wished to inform the Tsar
that he intended paying him a visit of some days’ duration
at his estate&mdash;(I have forgotten the name of it).
Bismarck dissuaded him on the ground that the Tsar
liked to be alone there, and because the Emperor had
not made a very favourable impression in St. Petersburg.
His Majesty asked how he came to know that. B. replied
through a private letter; whereupon the Emperor desired
to see it. B. at first did not wish to show it; but
finally, yielding to further pressure, drew it out of his
pocket. The Emperor, after he had read it, ordered the
carriage to stop, and set down the Chancellor at his
residence.</p>

<p>It was evident from the foregoing that in my affair
the Prince wanted to know&mdash;and in certain circumstances
to alter, and probably to a great extent&mdash;whether I was
in a position, and what I might perhaps be inclined to
say about himself, and indeed generally. Hence Kröner’s
proposition. In that case, however, I could not, as I had
hoped, do a service to the truth and to history, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span>
therefore could only write an empty book. I therefore
informed Bucher I would tell Kröner that an alteration
in my health would prevent me from carrying out our
contract, and beg him to cancel it. This was done in a
letter from Leipzig on the 11th of October; and I was
relieved from that burden and anxiety.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th of January, 1892, I again
spent an hour with Bucher at his place in Berlin, and
found him the same dear old friend. His hopeless feeling
with regard to the “Memoirs” had only grown deeper since
I saw him last. In the interval he had paid a further
long visit to Friedrichsruh, where he remained till shortly
before Christmas. He was to return again soon on the
Prince’s invitation, although the gout in his hands had
begun again on the previous Sunday to give him great
trouble, and the outlook and condition of affairs in the
Sachsenwald pleased him less than ever. “Thank your
stars that you are not in my place with these ‘Memoirs,’”
he said. “One’s work is in every respect void of profit
and pleasure. One exhausts himself on an utterly
hopeless task, which will yield nothing for history. It is
not alone that his memory is defective, and he has little
interest in what we have done&mdash;up to the present he has
looked through very few of my packets&mdash;but he begins
also intentionally to misrepresent even plain and well-established
matters of fact and occurrences. He will
not admit his own share in anything that has failed, and
he will acknowledge no one to be of any consequence
compared to himself, except perhaps the old Emperor
(to whom he now, as a foil to the young Emperor, gives
a much higher place than he is fairly entitled to) and
General Alvensleben&mdash;I cannot say why&mdash;who concluded
the treaty with Russia and commanded at Vionville.
Falk also is now praised, perhaps because he fears he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span>
might otherwise retort with disclosures. (But of course
these ‘Memoirs’ are not to be published at all.) He insists
that he is in no way responsible for the Kulturkampf,
that he did nothing to oppose Pio Nono’s views respecting
the Infallibility, and just as little against Arnim’s
mischievous ambition&mdash;although everybody knows the
contrary to be the fact. As if he and his work did not
shed enough light to enable men to overlook such
shadows! Even in cases where his policy was brilliantly
successful he will not hear of acknowledging anything,
as for instance the trap which he set for Napoleon
in the Spanish affair. He denied the letter to Prim until
I reminded him that I myself handed it to the general
in Madrid, and that the world is now well aware of
it through Rothan.” (So I understood the name, but
perhaps he meant Grammont.) On this occasion Bucher
also referred once more to his zigzag journey with Salazar
and his audience with King Wilhelm at Ems. “The
whole candidature of the Prince of Hohenzollern,” said
Bucher, “is now represented by Bismarck as having
been a purely private affair of the Court, a mere family
matter, although he was obliged to confess that it was
discussed at a sitting of the entire Ministry.”&mdash;I also
added some reminiscences, but observed in conclusion
that in spite of all that, the Chief remained the great
political genius and saviour of the Germans. But he
was not qualified to be a historian. He was to such a
large extent the author of the history of the past
decades that it might be called his history, but he did
not understand how to relate it. Bucher, of course,
agreed with me, and then continued his account of the
last few weeks. Bismarck wanted to attend the
Reichstag at all costs, in order to speak against the
Commercial Treaties. It was in vain to point out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span>
him the danger of malicious and coarse attacks from the
Richter and Bebel corners of the House, and to warn
him that the President would now be at liberty to call
him also to order. “In that case I would answer him
ironically” was the laughing reply. It was only
Schweninger who succeeded in dissuading him on
medical grounds.&mdash;“Hoffmann, of the <cite lang="de">Hamburger Nachrichten</cite>,
comes every week, and prints whatever the
Prince says to him, quite indifferent to the fact whether
it is a well-considered statement, or the contrary.”
“An old copying clerk has now been set to work on the
‘Memoirs,’ as Chrysander, to whom I dictate my notes, is
overburdened with other things, and can no longer
manage all the copying.” “They are to be left as a
bequest to the sons, but will hardly be published by
them,”&mdash;because they know that they contain too many
misrepresentations of a kind which people could detect
and easily disprove, and because they are full of unjust
judgments on prominent personages, as, for instance, on
most of the Prince’s former colleagues. At the very
most, a last chapter might ultimately be published on
the preliminary stages of his disgrace, and ultimate
retirement. Herbert has made copious and reliable
notes on this subject, in which, however, the old
gentleman has made all sorts of inaccurate and false
corrections. The Princess is still the same.... On
my asking after the daughter, Bucher fetched a bottle
of old Hungarian wine from behind the green curtain
of a bookcase. Countess Rantzau had brought it with
her from Hamburg for him, and we drank a glass of it
to the health of the honest and excellent lady who had
always been a friend to him. “And not forgetting our
old master,” I added. “How is he getting on?”
“Our old lion is well,” he replied, “and is always in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span>
good humour at table; eats and drinks heartily, cracks
a joke, and is equal to the youngest of them in paying
court to the fair ones.”</p>

<p>In the course of his remarks Bucher mentioned as
“not inconceivable” that the Prince might return one
day to his old place in Berlin.&mdash;He did not give his
reasons for thinking so. In the absence of such reasons,
and they would have to be very good ones, I cannot
believe in such a possibility, so far as he personally is
concerned. It is not impossible, after the ill-success
of the present <i lang="fr">régime</i>, that the spirit of his policy may
return to the palace in the Wilhelmstrasse.</p>

<p>We were not destined to meet again. Bucher died
on the 12th of October, 1892, after he had lived away
from the Prince for a few months. I gave a sketch of
his life and character in the <cite lang="de">Illustrirte Zeitung</cite> of the
29th of October, which was accompanied by a good
portrait.</p>

<p>Next spring I could find no rest until I greeted the
Prince once more; and I was permitted to do so. I
arrived at Friedrichsruh at 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 1st of May.
Chrysander and a servant waited for me at the station,
and conducted me to the house where I was lodged in
room No. 4. After a snack, which took the place of
lunch, I went for a walk with Chrysander, who then
showed me in one of the ground floor rooms a number
of presents and beautiful addresses from Costa Rica and
California, which had come to the Prince on his birthday
a month previously. Before dinner I met the old
gentleman in the coffee-room, where hung the portraits
of his ancestors. He has changed very little. I must
sit down with him on the sofa, and am “Büschlein” as
before. Had I written anything lately, and what about?
Complained of faceache, “which, however, comes no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span>
doubt from the sharp atmosphere out of doors during
my walk this morning.”&mdash;At dinner, at which we were
joined by the Princess, Countess Rantzau, Dr. Schweninger,
Count Herbert and von Kardorff, member of the
Reichstag, my place is again next the Prince on his
right. As is almost invariably the case on such occasions,
he is amiable, lively and good-humoured. (...)</p>

<p><i>May 2nd, at 11 a.m.</i>&mdash;Schweninger called at my
room as he was going away. We spoke once more about
Bucher, whom he praised highly. Long before the 15th
of March the doctor had known, “through his connections
at Court” of the Emperor’s intention to get rid of
Bismarck, and had informed the latter. At 12 o’clock
Chrysander summoned me to the Prince, whom I met
alone in the dining-room, where he was waiting for me.
I first handed him back the three metallographic copies,
which I should get published in some weekly paper as
they were still of interest. After I had turned the conversation
on Bucher I mentioned his mission to Madrid
and the letter to Prim, giving him clearly to understand
that I had been fully informed by my
deceased friend of every detail of his Spanish journey,
and also knew that at one time he wished to
deny the letter to Prim and the trap set for Napoleon,
which he had baited afresh by condensing the Ems
despatch. But to repudiate that would be to remove
the finest leaf from his wreath of laurels, and so on.
These details recalled to him the whole circumstances,
and he no longer denied anything. He brought the
conversation to a close with the words: “We will talk
it over some other time. Of course you will remain
for a while yet, and I must now speak to Kardorff.”
No opportunity however occurred of returning to the
subject. (...)</p>

<p>After dinner in the evening, <i lang="de">Kommerzienrath</i> Kröner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span>
over our coffee, recommended the Prince to pay an early
visit to Leipzig. The Chief Burgomaster Georgi had
told him that they longed to see the Prince there, and
that he would be received with universal enthusiasm.
I considered it right to tone down the effect of this
statement by pointing out that, in addition to sincere
but silent veneration for the Prince, there was also a
great deal of loud and obtrusive fustian and party self-seeking,
whose sole object was its own advancement;
that, together with a certain understanding for Bismarck’s
methods and aims, there was also a great deal
of unreason; and that the great lights of the National
Liberal persuasion, who held the upper hand at Leipzig,
would think less of manifesting their gratitude to him
than of once more giving prominence to themselves and
their party, and gaining popularity for future elections
to the Municipal Council or the Reichstag. Our
<i lang="de">Geheimer Kommerzienrath</i> was obviously unable to
appreciate such an unbusinesslike argument. What I
said was, however, perfectly true.</p>

<p><i>May 3rd.</i>&mdash;Took a walk in the morning. In the
garden, near the road leading to the station, was a
block of sandstone with the inscription: “From
Grotenburg, near the site of the monument to Arminius
in the Teutoburger Wald,” which was recently
presented to Bismarck “by a German,” a bookbinder
of Detmold. He doubtless knows no more than the
learned themselves where the Teutoburger Wald was
really situated, but he certainly knows better than
many of the learned that Bismarck is the founder
of the German Empire. In addition to the Chief and
his wife and daughter, only Chrysander and myself
were present at lunch. Conversation: On the newspaper
report that Rottenburg was about to pay the Prince
a visit, of which, however, the latter knew nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span>
and which is all the more improbable, as Rottenburg
is just engaged to Miss Phelps, the daughter of the
American Minister. The Chief mentioned that Mr.
Phelps wrote to him recently, and asked for an expression
of opinion on the World’s Fair at Chicago&mdash;of
course a favourable one. The Prince, however, does not
seem inclined to do this. He said: “If I were to give
an honest expression of my view it would not be what
he requires. These exhibitions are of little value for
industry and art, and are more for the benefit of hotel
keepers and such people. They are good for those who
feel bored, who want a new sensation, new amusements,
and who have money enough to gratify their inclinations
and afford themselves such pleasures.” The most
gracious and his intimates were then discussed&mdash;a
General von Versen is one of the favourites. The conversation
then turned on the diplomatic world, and first
on Marschall, who has little capacity, but has been
recommended by his Grand Duke and a relative (or an
official); on von Schweinitz, who has nine children, and
also on “Sardanapaul” Hatzfeldt. The Chief afterwards
referred to Maximilian Harden (Witkowski), whom he
praised as “a quiet unpretentious man of great tact;
not at all like a Jew&mdash;and also not like my intimate
friend Blum,” he added, laughingly, as he looked towards
the Princess. On the mention of the Grand
Duke of Baden I reminded him of his letter with the
words, “You cannot govern without Bismarck,” and of
the letter written by the Crown Prince Frederick from
Portofino in which he described his son. The Chief said
that he no longer had the original, and asked me to send
him a copy of it. “But not direct through the post,
and also not to Dr. Chrysander,” suggested Countess
Rantzau. “No, he will also be watched. Send it to
Baron Merck, Sachsenwald bei Reinbeck; I shall then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span>
get it safely.” I further referred to the King of Saxony
and his regard for Bismarck, and I mentioned that a
doctor, who at the time acted as Physician in Ordinary
to the King at Pillnitz, told me how, immediately after
the Prince’s dismissal, the King travelled alone by night
from Pillnitz to Berlin, probably for the purpose of a
conference with the Emperor or Caprivi.</p>

<p>On Bötticher’s name coming up after the diplomatists,
the Prince placed him even below Caprivi, and
concluded as follows: “Moreover, he is under petticoat
government.” Of Marschall he said: “He writes
bad French, even in official documents, speaking for
instance in a recent communication to Italy of ‘<i lang="fr">l’empereur
et l’empereuse</i>.’”</p>

<p><i>May 4th.</i>&mdash;At lunch we were joined by Baroness
Merck and a professor from Giessen, who plied the
Prince with all sorts of questions, and whom we shall
here entitle Herr Y. In the course of this inquisition
we ascertained, among other things, that “Dutken
Sommer” (in Hesekiel’s book), whom I had hitherto
taken to be a countrywoman, is in reality of the masculine
gender, and the son of the Pastor at Reinfeld. The
Prince said he was blind, and somewhat of a simpleton,
while the Princess described him as musical. Y. hastily
jotted that and other facts down in his pocket book
while discussing his cutlet and omelette. Phelps,
Chicago, and the Prince’s opinion of these “World
Fairs” once more. The Chief then spoke of Prince and
Princess Reuss at Vienna, and of the position she took
up towards the notorious rescript. (“The Uriah
Letters.”) She said: “My husband is a (public) servant.
I am not.” Somebody brought up Ahlwardt’s name, and
the Prince said: “He too has one merit. He brings a
change into the commonplace tediousness of the Reichstag.”
He observed with regard to the good reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span>
accorded to the Emperor by the Swiss: “They do nothing
gratis. We shall be made to pay for it with a higher
customs duty.” The professor informed us that he was
a vegetarian, and that it was an illness which had converted
him. I mentioned the approaching advent of the
editor of the <cite lang="de">Kladderadatsch</cite> and his friend Jacobsen,
praising both of them highly. After a glance at his
pocket book, Y. inquired about the attitude of France in
1866, mentioning Moustier. The Prince corrected his
pronunciation of the name, and then went on to say:
“Once in the course of conversation he reminded me in
a threatening way of Jena. I said to him, ‘If you talk
to me of Jena I will talk to you of Leipzig.’ I might
also have mentioned Waterloo. Moustier then complained
to Manteuffel, and he reported the matter to the
King, who, however, said that I had acted rightly.”
Coming in the further course of the conversation to
speak of the policy which was at that time pursued by
the Italians, he said: “La Marmora was a scoundrel, and
was paid by France, but Govone was a respectable man.”
He gave his reasons for both opinions in detail. The
Prince then added, having perhaps noticed the eavesdropping
publicist: “I would not have said that to
Sybel if I had had any idea that he would publish it&mdash;a
remark which applies to other matters mentioned to
other good people, such as my worthy friend Blum,
whose statements are very indiscreet and mostly false.”</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the professor came to my room, “in order
to become better acquainted with his neighbour”; that is,
thought I to myself, to pump me too for his own purposes,
<i lang="la" title="about everything and more too">de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis</i>, according
to all the rules of the art. And so it proved. He suggested
a walk, and I proposed that we should go to the
mill on the Aue. We had not gone a hundred yards
before he set to work as I had anticipated, with a hardihood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span>
which was only equalled by its many-sidedness.
Truly a thirst for knowledge of the most naïve kind, as
if it were the most natural thing in the world, although
it was only two hours since he set eyes on me for the
first time. As at lunch, the result was in each instance
immediately committed to his pocket book. What a
lingual pumping apparatus that was! Now here, now
there, sounding and boring, screwing and sucking! First
about myself, then as to Bucher, his character as an
official and in social life, &amp;c. The Prince’s turn came
next, and after him the Princess, the sons, the daughter
and the grandchildren. What did I think of Schweninger?
How did I like Lange, who, by the way, also
took lunch with us; in short, his inquiries, conducted
with a peculiar thoroughness and charm, extended to
everything upstairs and downstairs, chick and child,
<i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. I was even expected to give information
respecting Baroness Merck. Had I observed at table
that her eyes looked as if she had been crying, and that
she sobbed a couple of times? And whether I knew or
suspected why? In return he spontaneously revealed
his own inner man unasked, and as a reward for my
patience I ascertained a variety of things about himself,
and also obtained some information which appeared to
me to be of importance. He is to write an obituary of
the Prince for the <cite lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</cite>&mdash;now? He will
publish an account of his visit to him&mdash;where? He had
been to see him last year, if I rightly understood, at
Varzin, and had been for a walk with him for nearly two
hours. He is an intimate friend of Aegidi, whom, doubtless
as a congenial soul, he praises to the skies, and
who, he says, once gave him a document from the
archives of the Foreign Office for perusal. He is a
vocalist, and intends to sing something to the Princess,
&amp;c. I answered his questions, for the most part with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span>
expression of regret at my ignorance, and where this
was not possible with that description of truth which is
alone expedient in the presence of embarrassing or
dangerous curiosity: <i lang="da">Sanheden ved modification</i>, truth
with modifications, as the Danes jestingly define lies. I
took an opportunity before dinner to speak to Chrysander
about this odd fish. He was, however, just on the point
of fetching him to see the Prince. I thought to myself
that Bucher ought to have postponed his death for a
while. At dinner Y., who again diligently pumped the
Prince for the benefit of his note-book, strongly urged
him soon to pay a visit to South Germany and the
Rhine, and held out a very tempting prospect there.
The Chief, however, replied that, like Parson Primrose,
he now preferred the journey from the brown bed into
the blue to all others. “Were I to go, however,” he
continued, “I should prepare a speech once for all and
learn it by heart.” He added an experience of his at
the time of the Erfurt Parliament: “There was one of
them there who spoke often and well, and who, on one
occasion, delivered a speech which I heard and liked.
On my mentioning it to an acquaintance, however, he
said: ‘Yes, but you should have heard it last year; it
was much finer then!’”</p>

<p><i>May 5th.</i>&mdash;In the morning a letter from my little
Gretchen, with greetings to the dear Prince and the
whole princely family. Y. called for me again and
we took a walk through the wood along the road leading
to Möhnsen. The octopus again applies a new sucker:
he wants to know about the “Memoirs.” Had formerly
on one occasion (I believe he said in 1891) seen the
Prince over a pile of folio sheets. Could these have
been the “Memoirs?” I did not know, but doubted it.
“I did not wish to ask him,” observed the good creature.
At lunch he cheerfully proceeded with the work of extracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span>
information from the Chief. He had evidently
turned a deaf ear to the indirect warning as to “indiscreet
friends,” or considered that full-blown professors
formed an exception.</p>

<p>I delivered Gretchen’s greetings, and was instructed
to thank her very kindly. In the afternoon Chrysander
came to my room and begged me to send him from
Leipzig my opinion of the professor and the “intimate
friend.” “It is my duty,” he said, “to protect his
Serene Highness against tactlessness.”</p>

<p>After dinner, when the Mercks, who had also been
present, had withdrawn, there was a scene in the coffee
room. The indefatigable Y. once more addressed a series
of questions to the Prince, whose newspaper hour had
arrived, but who nevertheless listened to him politely,
until suddenly&mdash;I did not notice to what special point
the sucker had been applied, but it must have been an
exceptionally tender spot&mdash;he exclaimed angrily: “You
should not put such questions, professor. I cannot
imagine how any one can put such idiotic questions.”
Tableau! A thunderbolt! Silence for a moment, and
then the conversation is resumed with the ladies on
matters of no importance, while the Chief studies his
paper. On Y. rising to leave, the Countess makes a sign
to me to remain, and I talk for some time to her and
the Princess. On taking leave I kiss the Chief’s hand
for the first time, and doubtless also for the last. He
says: “Good-bye, dear old friend, but come back again
soon.”</p>

<p>In the meantime may God protect our dear old
master from his new friends&mdash;his business friends!
Amen!</p>

of Justice, was a baptised Jew from Bohemia.</p>


<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> As far back as the 2nd of April, 1858, he wrote from Frankfurt to
a friend (see Hesekiel, page 183): “I believe that the Zollverein, which
must be reorganised after 1865 ... will provide an opportunity of
securing the exercise of the right of federal consent in customs matters
on the lines of the Union scheme of 1849, and establishing a kind of
customs parliament.” On the 18th of September, 1861, in a letter to a
friend, which was written at Stolpmunde on the way from St. Petersburg
to Berlin (same work, page 189), he said: “I do not see why we should
be so coy and reserved with regard to the idea of popular representation,
whether in the form of a confederation or of a customs parliament. An
institution which enjoys legitimate authority in every German State, and
which even the Conservatives in Prussia would not willingly dispense
with, cannot be opposed as revolutionary.... In that way one might
create a thoroughly Conservative national representation, and at the same
time secure the gratitude of even the Liberals.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> On the 13th of September, 1883, Bucher’s brother, Bruno, who is
settled in Vienna, told us at Helbig’s in Leipzig, that Lothar Bucher had
also been at Sigmaringen with Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern in the
spring of 1870. Grunow was present on this occasion.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> The word “züfflich” is given in the original letter. Dr. Busch

<p>The following changes have been made to the text as printed. In
cases of doubt, recourse has been had to the original German work
(<cite lang="de">Tagebuchblätter</cite>).</p>

<p>1. Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.</p>

<p>2. Errors in use of quote marks and other punctuation have been
corrected.</p>

<p>3. In cases of inconsistent spelling of German and French names, the
spelling used in the original language has been preferred. Examples
include changing "Frankfort" to "Frankfurt", "Mayence" to "Mainz",
"Rheims" to "Reims", "Delbruck" to "Delbrück". However, where the
English text is consistent in spelling, that spelling has been retained
("Cologne", "Munich").</p>

<p>4. Where a word is used repeatedly in the same way, hyphenation has
been made consistent, preferring the form most often used in the
printed work, or failing that the more usual form in general use at the
time of publication.</p>

<p>5. Some entries in the Index have been amended for consistency with the
reference in the main text.</p>
